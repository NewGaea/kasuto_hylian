# Neo-Modern Hylian Grammatical Cheatsheet

This serves as a quick reference sheet to grammatical rules and markers, including how to combine them.
## Basic Markers

		4. **Masculine:** *-il-*
		5. **Feminine:** *-in-*
2. **Genitive**
	1. **Singular:** *-sa, -su*
	2. **Plural:** *-san, -sun*
3. **Adjectives**
	1. **Singular:** *-a*
	2. **Plural:** *-an*

## Compound Markers

1. **Agent & Patient**
	1. **Agent Nouns** are denoted by the **simple present verb** *-as* and **noun** *-e,* for the performer of a transitive verb *-ase* (***kriashase*** "creator")
	2. **Patient Nouns** are denoted by a special form of the passive adjunct *-ashiut* followed by the noun ending *-e*, for the patient of a verb *-ashiute* (***kriashashiute*** "creation")
	3. Due to the nature of Hylian role marking, **Patient**
2. **Gerunds & Participles**
	1. The **non-finite** verb can serve as an infinitive or gerund, but one can avoid or reduce confusion by using the **non-finite verb** form *-ag,* and adding a noun ending *-e* for an *-age* ending (***kriashage*** "creating")
	2. **Participles** can be formed in two ways
		1. **Standard participles** simply use the non-finite form (***kriashasag dégine*** "creating goddess")
		2. **Informal participles** use a simple tense (*-as, -es, -os*) and then add an **adjective ending** (*-a, -an*) to that
