This is the **Beginner's Guide to Classical Hylian**, written by the **Hylian Linguistic Society** for those who want to get into speaking, writing, or typing Classical Hylian without studying all the fancy linguistics.

This guide will be composed of short lessons on how to say and discuss certain topics, while our more advanced **[Classical Hylian Primer](grammar/advanced/00_hls-intro)** is available for the more scholarly of language learners.

**Classical Hylian** is a language originally created by **[[contributors/kasuto|Kasuto of Kataan]]** on his website, but which has been picked up in 2023 by **[[contributors/jerin_of_calatia|Jerin of Calatia]]** to be reinvigorated as an open-source language for fans of _The Legend of Zelda,_ including organizing the **Hylian Linguistic Society.** The language is loosely based on the script and timeframe of the Nintendo<sup>64</sup> games, with a high level of artistic liberty taken.

One of the biggest goals in this guide is to make Hylian as approachable and accessible as possible. To this end, we are using the simplest and cleanest manner of writing Hylian using Latin script, so everybody should be able to read it. We are also not starting with a focus on speech, but on written and typed communication, so the language is readily usable in online fan-spaces.
