## Greetings & Pleasantries

When Hylians meet acquaintances in public, they will often make a comment about weather or local gossip. It is considered rude to ask about health or relationships as a casual discussion topic, unless the speakers are quite close and have some particular reason to ask, such as knowledge of a recent illness.

Most casual conversations will play out something like this:

> 	**Antinai**: (Time appropriate greeting)
> 	**Bagethur**: (Same greeting)
> 	**Antinai**: (Comment about weather)
> 	**Bagethur**: (Agreement)

So let's look at a few of the options for how to fill in such a conversation more precisely.

### Greetings & Salutations

As such casual conversations will often begin with a time-related greeting, let's consider the three most common such greetings.

| Hylian | Romanized | Translation |
|:-------|:----------|:------------|
| <span class="hylian_kas">vina minazi<br>vina minaze</span> | Vina minazi<br>Vina minaze | Good morning |
| <span class="hylian_kas">vina tîdri<br>vina tîdre</span> | Vina tiudri<br>Vina tiudre | Good day, good afternoon |
| <span class="hylian_kas">vina nãstri<br>vina nãstre</span> | Vina naistri<br>Vina naistre | Good evening, Good night |

In general , the first person to use one of these greetings will use the **topical form** which ends in the letter \<i\> while the responder (or responders) use the simple form ending with the letter \<e\>. The forms listed here are also _only_ used for greetings -- when you depart, the words take on a different form.

In our context, the words _minaze_ and _minazi_ refer to the period from the crack of dawn until noon -- if you wake up before the sun, these words are still appropriate, though -- while _tiudre_ and _tiudri_ refer to afternoon, from noon until as early as 5 PM or as late as 8 PM (changes by season), and _naistre_ and _naistri_ refer to the evening and night, they are acceptable as early as 5 PM until as late as 2-3 AM.

### Weather Comments

Comments are usually kept simple, with room for agreement or disagreement, but not so much for discussion.

| Hylian | Romanized | Translation |
|:-------|:----------|:------------|
| <span class="hylian_kas">Vina vëntre tãras jano?</span> | Vina vëntre naz tairas jano? | Good weather, isn't it? |
| <span class="hylian_kas">cucua naz tãras jano?</span> | Cucua naz tairas jano? | It's hot, isn't it? |
| <span class="hylian_kas">Dagola naz tãras jano?</span> | Dhagola naz tairas jano? | It's cold, isn't it? |
| <span class="hylian_kas">a, sesole shite sesolag jano?</span> | A, sesole shite sesolag jano? | It's really raining, huh? |
| <span class="hylian_kas">hã, ru tãras.</span> | Hai, ru tairas. | Yes, it is. |
| <span class="hylian_kas">nani, ru këuma naz tãras.</span> | Nani, ru këuma naz tairas. | No, it's not so bad. |

In Hylian, it is considered genial to make a short and simple response to these sorts of weather comments, and while it is usually preferred to agree, a friendly _nani_ doesn't tend to go amiss -- as long as you don't start to argue. This is one of the reasons we recommend that, if you must disagree on the weather, you use a plain factive statement like the one above, rather than, "I don't mind it." 

These are the initial greetings and opening comments acquaintances might make -- but closer friends may be markedly more casual, opting for greetings such as _minazi_ (without saying _vina_) or the like, and asking more personal questions.

## Practice Session

Below are three interactions between **Antinai** and **Bagethur.** Look them over and try to identify the time of day and weather. Don't worry, we won't introduce any new concepts in these practice sessions.

1. **Antinai:** Vina minazi!
    **Bagethur:** Vina minaze...
    **Antinai:** Vina vëntre naz tairas jano?
    **Bagethur:** Hai, ru tairas.

2. **Bagethur:** Vina naistri, Antinai.
    **Antinai:** Vina naistre.
    **Bagethur:** A, sesole shite sesolag jano?
    **Antinai:** Hai, ru tairas.

3. **Antinai:** Vina tiudri.
    **Bagethur:** Vina tiudre.
    **Antinai:** Cucua naz tairas jano?
    **Bagethur:** Nani, ru këuma naz tairas.

4. _Now that you've read three short greetings, try writing a four-line greeting of this sort based on the **time of day** and the **local weather** where you are, at least as close as the provided phrases allow._

## Favors, Please & Thank You

Please always remember your manners when you have a favor ask. You don't need to worry about the specific grammar -- these words and phrases will serve you well in being polite when you need help.

These are all polite, to varying degrees -- in general, the longer the phrase is within this chart, the more polite it is.
