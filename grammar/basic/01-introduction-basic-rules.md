# Introduction to Classical Hylian

**Classical Hylian** is a conlang created by a fan of *The Legend of Zelda,* for use by other fans of the series. It is inspired by the games, and while it does have its own method of writing, we want to let you get started with the language as quickly as possible, so for the first ten lessons (including this one!) we will only be representing Classical Hylian using Latin script -- the same script you're reading right now. The language can br simplified in just a single set of rules:

## The Rules

1. The indefinite article is univerally _raz_ (equivalent to English _a, an_), and the definite article is universally _taz_ (equivalent to English _the_). The article is never mandatory, thus if understanding its use is difficult, it is valid to never use _taz_ at all.
2. **Nouns** end in _-e_ if they are singular (or collective) and _-ën_ if they are plural. This rule applies to the standard case, however there is also a **topical case** which replaces _-e_ with _-i_ and _-ën_ with _-ïn_, and a **vocative** which ends in _-ur, -ai,_ or _-oi_, based on the semantic gender of the referent.
3. **Adjectives** end in _-a_ if they describe a singular (or collective) noun, and _-an_ if they describe a plural noun.
4. The basic **numerals** are (without inflection): _hir, dis, tro, kos, pant, hënt, sit, ont, niv_ (one through nine, in order) and the larger basic numbers are _dëm, sal,_ and _mal_ (ten, hundred, and thousand.) They may be inflected as **nouns** when referring to the concept of the number, or when performing maths, or as **adjectives** when referring to the quantity of an object.
5. **Personal pronouns** all end in _-u_: _bagu, nosu, taiu, vosu, ëru, iëru, sëru, siëru, ru, iru, riu, iriu._
6. **Possessive nouns and pronouns** always add an unstressed suffix _-sa_ to the end, specifying their **adjectival** role.
7. **Verbs** are always regular, and do not conjugate for person or number. Verbs conjugate for **tense** in both **time** and **completion,** as well as the **infinitive** and **imperative.** Infinitive: _-ag_, Imperative _-ans_, simple tenses _-as_ (present), _-es_ (past), _-os_ (future), perfect tenses _-ant_ (present perfect), _-ënt_ (past perfect), _-ont_ (future perfect).
8. **Adverbs** end in _-ok_, and can be created by changing the **adjective suffix** to _-ok_. Adverbs do no inflect for number.
9. **Prepositions** end in any consonant -- they are otherwise unmarked.
10. Every word is read as it is written -- there are no silent letters in **Classical Hylian**. _**NOTE:** This is not true in the standard romanization, which uses a modifier \<h\> to indicate certain sounds._
11. The **primary stress** of a word falls on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable of a word, unless marked with the _asënte_ (as _é_) or circumflex (as _ê_). **Secondary stress** occurs on every alternate syllable before the **primary.**
12. New compound words are straightforward juxtapositions of words, with the primary word at the end.
13. Roles within statements or sentences are marked by the use of particles. The subject or agent is unmarked, while the **direct object** is marked by _ab_ or a contraction of _ab,_ and the **indirect object** is marked by _ank_ or a contraction of _ank._
14. **Foreign Words,** or words which are borrowed from other languages, are borrowed as-is except for conforming to the above grammatical rules. For example, the word _computer_ from English would become _kampyute_, while the _to compute_ would become _kampyutag._
15. If in doubt, you may construct Classical Hylian sentences as if they are English -- most readers and writers of the language will probably be familiar enough to figure out the meaning.

## Goals

The goals of this book are (1) to let you type messages using Hylian structures and words and (2) help you understand how Hylians speak differently from your native language. This documentation is brand new, not simply a repeat of Kasuto's grammar documents (even the Primer only uses Kasuto's work as a guideline). We wish you well as you enter the community of Hylian speakers, even if you can only type it.

Aroti!
