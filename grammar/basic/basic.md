# basic Overview

This folder contains the textbook-style grammar, How to Speak Hylian. This is intended to be an e-book that functions like a 14-week introductory course to Neo-Modern Hylian.

We have a more introductory level textbook in [Oztin's Primer for Hylian](oztin-primer.md) and a more advanced guide in the works as the [Hylian Reference Grammar](advanced.md)
