# Introduction to the Hylian Linguistics Society's _Neo-Modern Hylian_ Project
---

## Foreword

We at the **Hylian Linguistics Society** appreciate the work and documentation provided by **[Kasuto of Kataan](contributors/kasuto)** in his research and publication of information on the **Hylian Language.** As he originally wrote, "There are several websites out there which claim to provide Hylian Dictionaries." As of 2023, his website is but one of those several, and appears to be as well tended to as many which date as far back as his own.

We at the **Hylian Linguistics Society** seek to preserve and revive this language as an open source community project hosted on GitHub, as well as to expand and develop more members of the **Mudoran** and **Hylian** language family. Our primary file format is an Obsidian Vault, which is (largely speaking) a collection of plain-text Markdown files which may also include **wikilinks** and **HTML snippets** inside of them. The vault itself may also contain any other type of media files, such as fonts, image files, audio files, video files, and more.

We take the perspective that we are documenting historical languages, and place ourselves as near to the end of **The Legend of Zelda's** timeline as we can. This currently means we assume ourselves to be working in the aftermath of **Tears of the Kingdom.**

### Copyright

We believe that a language cannot be subject to copyright, even though the documentation for a language can. However, if one, or one's organization, is the sole source of documentation, we believe that enforcing copyright is poor stewardship of a tool for communication -- whether that language is natural or artificial.

**However,** we recognize that international copyright law grants us copyright over this work, whether we hold enforcement of such rights to be morally justified or not. The **Mudoran** and **Hylian** language families produced by the HLS are recognized as protected by Copyright, and so we choose to license them in a widely free culture compatible manner:

## Background

Thanks go to **Kasuto of Kataan** of [Kasuto.net](https://kasuto.net) for developing the original language. This project is an extension of a permission granted to Austin Springer by Kasuto several years ago, and if he should ask us to take it down, we shall.

We members of the Hylian Linguistic Society do not, in fact, live within Hyrule. We live on modern-day Earth, and engage in this project for fun, to appease an intellectual or emotional itch to become more invested in a world we love. To this end, we imagine stories about the world that occur between the glimpses the games of the series show us. In this project, we indulge our curiosity for the languages, cultures, and histories of the world in which Hyrule is set.

We welcome contributions from others, as we are already in the process of incorporating archived discussion threads from the community that **Kasuto** fostered on his own forums, **The Vinculum.** While the forums are crashed as we write this, we have preserved a few threads by dumping text we deemed relevant to the project. These threads may be found in the root directory, and after processing will be moved into the `archive/vinculum/` directory.

**We readily welcome all help from former members of Kasuto's Vinculum forums who were involved with the language.** We also readily accept help from others with their own Hylian language interests. It is our goal that the lexicon of this Hylian language be developed in a democratic manner, only following the original guidelines for how words are formed, which is largely to say that every part of speech is grammatically marked by its ending elements.

### Kasuto's Work, Summarized

Kasuto started the project to create a language that was more than just words that fit the interests of storytelling: He set forth to establish the grammar rules, the sounds of the language, and enough words to tell some stories. It is unclear if Kasuto was a linguist, though he did call himself "fairly competent in English mechanics and grammar," and also that he had "in \[sic\] interest in foreign languages." It is possible that he did study linguistics as either a hobby or formally, as he noted in his original introduction that he speaks Spanish, was studying Arabic, and had future plans to study Chinese and Japanese. He also noted explicit inspiration from **Esperanto,** the **international auxiliary language** created by Dr. L. L. Zamenhof.

Kasuto started with the grammar, choosing what grammatical function to use for the language, and decided to use an Esperantish system of grammar marking, where words can be divided into stems and grammatically marked endings -- endings which can (though he never strictly documented this) be stacked together -- which identify what part of speech a word fills, such as the ending \<e\> for all singular nouns and \<ën\> for all plural nouns, while leaving no rule for proper nouns.

Beyond that, Kasuto kept a syntax similar to English, with sentences following the Subject-Verb-Object, or SVO, structure, and threw in a healthy mix of various Indo-European languages with hints of Japanese, such as various particles to mark the structure of more complicated sentences.

Lastly, he chose the sounds and writing system. The sounds he chose are not all that extreme (and we of the HLS preserve them), and the writing system he chose is alphabetic, where each written glyph, or letter, represents a sound. The main difference between the Hylian and Latin scripts is that Hylian is strictly phonemic: Each letter in Hylian represents one sound only, with blocky shapes similar to those seen in _Ocarina of Time_ and _Majora's Mask_. These blocky shapes are composed of only horizontal and vertical lines, connected (where they are connected) by right angles, and are of uniform width and height. Kasuto's Hylian script also chooses to be single-cased -- meaning that there is only one form for each letter, no upper case and lower case.

### Austin Springer's Work

As of 2016, **[Austin Springer](austin-springer.md)** reached out for permission to compile an updated version of Kasuto's language on their own website. While the project never materialized into a mirror site, much plain-text documentation was produced during the period from 2016 until 2021. **Austin's** objective was to develop more lore and documentation for the language, independently from **Kasuto** who seemed to have stopped all published work on the language. **Austin** identified, as a goal, bringing the language to a state which could be used to translate one or more of the video games in _The Legend of Zelda_ series.

**Austin** also wanted to develop related languages from **Kasuto's**, and their own, timelines of the series. **Austin** primarily looked into the community of the language and documented as much of the community interest in extending the language as they could, and ultimately decided that the project was not one well-suited to a single person. They passed the torch on to **Jerin of Calatia,** who has decided to establish the **Hylian Linguistic Society** and open up this language as a fork of **Kasuto's** project.

### Jerin of Calatia

As of July 2023, the project has been joined by **Jerin of Calatia,** (GitHub: gaeaJen6L27), who has dumped Austin's copies of Kasuto's documentation, and Austin's own archival work, in a GitHub repository managed by the **New Gaea Entertainment** organization. In this process, **Jerin** is establishing the **Hylian Linguistic Society,** in order to welcome new contributors to the language.

We have done very little to the documentation at this point, but have started compiling a new lexicon file, and rebooting the documentation.

**Bënkati, tokahitën!**
