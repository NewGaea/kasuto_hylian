# advanced Overview

This folder contains the contents of the advanced-level Hylian Reference Grammar. This will go into high levels of detail about how Neo-Modern Hylian works. For a simpler introduction to practical use of the language, we have the introductory [Oztin's Primer for Hylian](oztin-primer.md) and the basic-level [How to Speak Hylian](basic.md).
