# Context of Neo-Modern Hylian
**Previous Chapter**: **[Introduction to Neo-Modern Hylian](grammar/advanced/00_hls_intro)**

Neo-Modern Hylian is spoken in Hyrule from roughly 50 years before the story of *Ocarina of Time* and remains the primary and official language of the land for about 2 centuries, before a renaissance leads to urban consolidation of much of the nation. The last Hyrulian Civil War, between the Gerudo and Hyrule, saw the King of the Gerudo submit to Hyrulian power, and adopt Modern Hylian as the official language of Gerudo administration.

Neo-Modern Hylian is a regularized form of the previously existing (and sometimes colloquially used) Modern Hylian language, which descends from a long line of languages beginning with the Mudoran language which was spoken in the time of the first great demon king Demise, and the queen-goddess Hylia.
