This contains a selection of sentences used in Duolingo courses, translated into Meo-Modern Hylian. Each sentence is sorted into a Section by folder and a unit by file, and is drawn from the phrasebook. The sentences are not merely translated, but glossed, so you can study the grammar more clearly.
