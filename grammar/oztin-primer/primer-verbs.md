# Hylian Verbs | Wirtën Hilanan

Hylian is a very regular language, and its verbs are no exception. Every verb in Hylian conjugates in the exact same patterns, there are no irregular verbs.

Hylian dictionaries list all verbs in their **non-finite** form, which is the fundamental form equivalent to several English forms and uses, but the **non-finite** form always ends in \<-**ag**>, \<-**ëg**>, or \<-**og**>. We will explain more about the non-finite uses a little bit later in this chapter, but the simplest thing to understand is that \<-**ag**> is the simple, present, non-finite form listed in our dictionaries, and is equivalent to both the English **to Verb** and **Verbing** forms. For the time being, we're going to start our examples with ***tairag*** the Hylian verb equivalent to English "to be" and "being"

## Basic Verb Tenses in Neo-Modern Hylian

|                | **Hylian** | **English**    |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Non-Finite** | *tairag*   | to be<br>being |
| **Present**    | *tairas*   | am, are, is    |
| **Past**       | *taires*   | was, were      |
| **Future**     | *tairos*   | will be        |

The root of every Hylian verb is the **Dictionary Form** which is also the simple non-finite form. You can turn a verb into a root word by dropping the \<-**ag**> at the end of the word, and you can then inflect the root into any other tense, or the state of that action in time.

There are two dimension of tense in Hylian: When an action occurs relative to the statement, and whether or not the action is completed within the statement. These are **TIME** and **PERFECT** tenses, and they combine together. The standard simple tenses listed in the table above are called either *simple* or *imperfect* tenses, along with their **TIME** tense.

English speakers are used to conjugating verbs in **time** and **perfectness** already, though not every combination of time and perfectness is allowed in English. English speakers are also used to conjugating for person and number! Just check this table for the forms "*to be*" can take in English,

|            | Singular     | Plural        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **1st Person** | I am         | We are        |
| **2nd Person** | You are      | You (all) are |
| **3rd Person** | He/She/It is | They are      |
| **4th Person** | One is       | Ones are      |
, and that's just for the present tense! I was, you were, he was, one will be... All of these are part of how English handles the mixtures of person, number, tense, and we add a "*have*" or "*had*" to show the perfectness of a verb!

Neo-Modern Hylian, on the other hand, is strictly and completely regular. If you want to talk about someone being (another form!) a certain way in Neo-Modern Hylian, you always just inflect it for **Time** and **Perfectness**, and the latter only if it is a completed act within the statement.

It doesn't matter if I **am**, you **are**, he **is**, or they **are**; in Hylian **bagu, tai•u, ëru, ëk iru *tairas***. Don't worry! We'll cover the pronouns in their own chapter, but we might still use a few in this lesson to help make sentences.
