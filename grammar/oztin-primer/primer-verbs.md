# Hylian Verbs | Wirtën Hilanan

Hylian is a very regular language, and its verbs are no exception. Every verb in Hylian conjugates in the exact same patterns, there are no irregular verbs.

Hylian dictionaries list all verbs in their **non-finite** form, which is the fundamental form equivalent to several English forms and uses, but the **simple non-finite** form always ends in \<-**ag**>. We will explain more about the full range of non-finite uses a little bit later in this chapter, but the simplest thing to understand is that \<-**ag**> is the simple, present, non-finite form listed in our dictionaries, and is equivalent to both the English **to Verb** and **Verbing** forms. For the time being, we're going to start our examples with ***tairag*** the Hylian verb equivalent to English "to be" and "being"

## Basic Verb Tenses in Neo-Modern Hylian

|                | **Hylian** | **English**    |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Non-Finite** | *tairag*   | to be<br>being |
| **Present**    | *tairas*   | am, are, is    |
| **Past**       | *taires*   | was, were      |
| **Future**     | *tairos*   | will be        |

The starting point of every Hylian verb is the **Dictionary Form** which is also the simple non-finite form. You can turn a verb into a _root word_ by dropping the \<-**ag**> at the end of the word, and you can then inflect the root into any other tense, or the state of that action in time.

There is only one dimension of tense in Hylian: When an action occurs relative to the statement. This is called **TIME**, and it combines together with several moods. The standard simple tenses listed in the table above are called either *basic* or *simple* mood, along with their **TIME** tense.

English speakers are used to conjugating verbs in **time** already. English speakers are also used to conjugating for person and number! Just check this table for the forms "*to be*" can take in English,

|            | Singular     | Plural        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **1st Person** | I am         | We are        |
| **2nd Person** | You are      | You (all) are |
| **3rd Person** | He/She/It is | They are      |
| **4th Person** | One is       | Ones are      |
, and that's just for the present tense! I was, you were, he was, one will be... All of these are part of how English handles the mixtures of person, number, tense, and we add a "*have*" or "*had*" to show the perfectness of a verb!

Hylian, on the other hand, is strictly and completely regular. If you want to talk about someone being (another form!) a certain way in Hylian, you always just inflect it for **Time** and one of several moods.

It doesn't matter if I **am**, you **are**, he **is**, or they **are**; in Hylian **bagu, tai•u, ëru, ëk iru *tairas***. Don't worry! We'll cover the pronouns in their own chapter, but we might still use a few in this lesson to help make sentences.

|                | Singular                                                           | Plural                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1st Person** | I am<br>**Bagu tairas**                                            | We are<br>**Nosu tairas**                                         |
| **2nd Person** | You are<br>**Tai•u tairas**                                        | You (all) are<br>**Vosu tairas**                                  |
| **3rd Person** | He/She/It is<br>**Ëru tairas**<br>**Sëru tairas**<br>**Ru tairas** | They are<br>**Iëru tairas**<br>**Siëru tairas**<br>**Iru tairas** |
| **4th Person** | One is<br>**Riu tairas**                                           | Ones are<br>**Iriu tairas**                                       |
## Verbal Mood

There are four moods in Neo-Modern Hylian -- the basic mood is used for most verbs, and just uses the suffixes \<-**as**> (present), \<-**es**> (past), and \<-**os**> (future). The basic or simple mood 

|                    | **Nonfinite**<br>\<-g>                        | Basic<br>\<-s>          | Perfect<br>\<-"nt>              | Imperative<br>\<-"ns>           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Present** \<-a-> | **tairag**<br>"to be"<br>"being"              | **tairas**<br>"it is"   | **tairant**<br>"it has been"    | **tairans**<br>"now be"         |
| **Past** \<-e->    | **taireg**<br>"to be before"<br>"having been" | **taires**<br>"it was"  | **tairënt**<br>"it had been"    | **tairëns**<br>"was told to be" |
| **Future** \<-o->  | **tairog**<br>"to be later"<br>"becoming"     | **tairos**<br>"will be" | **tairönt**<br>"will have been" | **tairöns**<br>"shall be"       |

Every Hylian verb must have a **tense** from the left and a **mood** from the top. But this might look a bit overwhelming, so let's address the **Basic** and **Perfect** tenses first.

### Basic Mood & Tense

The basic mood is used for most common words: "I like you," is an example of the basic present tense in English. To say the same thing in Neo-Modern Hylian, you would say: **Bagu goearas ab tai•u.**

The tenses are very similar to how English uses them, with the biggest difference being that there are fewer phrases used to express a tense. For example, you might notice that **Bagu goearos ab tai•u,** the Hylian expression meaning, "_I will like you,_" doesn't have a specific word for "will" -- **goearos** translates into the English phrase "will like."

#### Basic Present Tense
This tense describes an action which is happening at the time it is being said. Many of the actions we refer to in everyday life are used in present tense.
```ngloss
\ex Antinai tairas fëlzana
\gl Antinai [Antinai] [Antina]
	tair-as [be-BASPRES] [am]
	fëlzan-a [happiness-ADJSG] [happy]
\ft Antina is happy.
```
#### Basic Past Tense
This tense describes an action which was started in the past and is not happening in the present. This tense does not specify if the action was completed or not.
```ngloss
\ex Bagëthur koemes abz koeme
\gl Bagëthur [Bagethur] [Bageth]
	koem-es [eat-BASPAST] [ate]
	ab-z [DIROBJ-DEF] [the]
	koem-e [eat-NSG] [food]
\ft Bageth ate the food.
```

### Perfect Mood & Tense

The perfect mood is used to refer to an action which is specifically and explicitly completed at the time of reference. For example, in English you can say something like, "I have read the book," to indicate that you are now finished reading the book. This same sentence in Hylian is "**Bagu lërdant ab lërde**"
