# Overview: Oztin's Primer for Hylian
 
This folder contains the contents of a modernized and updated version of Kasuto's original language documents. Many sentences and examples have been updated, and new information relevant to Neo-Modern Hylian is also presented. This primer is a crash course on the language, and features dialogues using the same characters as the still-in-development basic-level [How to Speak Hylian](grammar/basic/basic.md) and the advanced-level [Hylian Reference Grammar](grammar/advanced/advanced.md).

This is intended to be a summary of the most important parts of Neo-Modern Hylian grammar, with a primary focus on typing or writing the language.
