# Introduction to the Hylian Linguistics Society's _Classical Hylian_ Project

## Foreword

We at the **Hylian Linguistics Society** appreciate the work and documentation provided by **Kasuto of Kataan** in his research and publication of information on the **Hylian Language.** As he originally wrote, "There are several websites out there which claim to provide Hylian Dictionaries." As of 2023, his website is but one of those several, and appears to be as well tended to as many which date as far back as his own.

We at the **Hylian Linguistics Society** seek to preserve and revive this language as an open source community project hosted on GitHub, as well as to expand and develop more members of the **Mudoran** and **Hylian** language family. Our primary file format is an Obsidian Vault, which is (largely speaking) a collection of plain-text Markdown files which may also include **wikilinks** and **HTML snippets** inside of them. The vault itself may also contain any other type of media files, such as fonts, image files, audio files, video files, and more.

We take the perspective that we are documenting historical languages, and place ourselves as near to the end of **The Legend of Zelda's** timeline as we can. This currently means we assume ourselves to be working in the aftermath of **Tears of the Kingdom.**
