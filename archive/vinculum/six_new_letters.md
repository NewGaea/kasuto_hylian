# Six New Letters
---

> [!NOTE] Unarchived Content!
> Austin appears to have forgotten to archive [the original post](http://kasuto.net/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9127), but if we find it we'll be sure to put it here. In the meantime, here's what Austin recollects:

From my archived [[keymap]] notes, it appears the six new letters are named

+ **_khate_** which represents the _kh_ digraph, font-mapped to K, x, and X
+ **_dhënte_** which represented the _dh_ digraph, the voiced version of _th,_ font-mapped to D
+ **_ûkte_** which represents the sound of _oo_ in _look_, font-mapped to û, with a stressed counterpart mapped to Û.
+ **_acete_** which represents the _ts_ sound in _cats_ or _tsunami_, font-mapped to c
+ **_chäte_** which represents the _ch_ sound in _chin,_ font-mapped to C
+ **_añate_** which represents the _ng_ soung in _anger_ or _firing_, font-mapped to N.

Sorry I didn't archive it at the time, I really feel foolish now. I'm at least glad that I got the letters incorporated into the Hylian 3.x fonts. Sorry again for the trouble.
