# taz daksunare hilana daia jerinoi<br>The Hylian Dictionary of Jerin
---
This is an English-language dictionary for Classical Hylian. In this dictionary, each word receives a full definition as well as a list of glosses or translations. Within this project, this means that every word gets its own dedicated note file, so that words can be explored more fully than a simple list. This dictionary is divided into one lister for every Base Letter in HLS Romanization, and unlike Classical Hylian, \<a\> and \<Ã¤>, as well as \<ai\> and \<au\> are all under the wordlist for \<A\>.
