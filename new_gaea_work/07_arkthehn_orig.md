## Forms of Address

In Hylian, there is a myriad of ways to address people. Most of the time, people don't simply use a person's name. Often, they attach some kind of word to the end of the name to indicate respect, frienship, or love. This is similar to the many suffixes that Japanese uses, like "-san", "-sama", etc.

### Names

Names are the base for most forms of address. In Hylian culture, a person's first name, or "given name" is usually used. Some people have family names, but they are seldom used. (ED: It may be more common to use one's home town, village, city, province, or tribe as a de facto surname.) Giving people a middle name is very uncommon in Hyrule, and you almost never see it.

When saying a person's full name, the family name (surname) and first name (given name), the family name is always said first. For example: _Ruzantaze Zelda_. _Ruzantaze_ is the surname of Hyrule's royal family (ED: artificial, all canonically named rulers are named _Hyrule_ within the games), _Zelda_ is the given name of the princess. Most of the time, a person's family name is only used when introducing someone. More commonly you will see a person's place of origin used instead of a family name. For example: _Kasuto da.ia Katane_. _Kasuto_ is the given name, and _Katane_ is Kasuto's place of origin, Kataan. The word _da.ia_ means "of." (ED: genitive of association, _da.ia_ means "of or from") For instance, Impa is from Kakariko village, so she could be addressed as _Impa da.ia Kakariko_. Most of the time however, people are simply addressed by their given name and a suffix. The different suffixes attached to people's names are listed below.
