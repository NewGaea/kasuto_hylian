Phonology of Hylian
===================

## The Sound of Hylian

> _**Note:** The following text is formulated by GaeaJen_2E67 to explain the phonology of the language in more detail than Kasuto provided._

The phonology of Modern Hylian is very similar to that of late 20th century English.

### Consonants

| | Bilabial | Dental | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Pharyngeal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **nasal** | m | | n | | ny | ng | |
| **stop** | p b | t d |  | k g |  |
| **affricate** |  |  | ts  | j |  |  | h |
| **fricative** | f v | th | s z | sh zh |  | kh\* |  |
| **approximant** |  | w | r |  |  |  |  |
| **lateral** |  |  | l |  | y |  |  |

### Vowels

| | front |  | central |  |  | back |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **close** | i |  |  |  |  | u |
|  |  | ï |  |  |  |  |
| **close mid** | e |  |  |  |  | o |
| **open mid** | ë |  |  |  |  | ü |
|  | ä |  |  |  |  |  |
| **open** |  |  |  | a |  |  |

**Diphthongs:** ai (aï), au, iu (yu), oa (aw), oi (oy)

All symbols in the charts above are _currently_ based on their standard transcription from Hylian, not IPA symbols. An alternative version of this guide, for language enthusiasts, will be produced using IPA. The charts above are based on the IPA tables, however. The consonant chart has been trimmed to only relevant rows and columns, while the vowel chart has been preserved with all rows and columns.

As an adaptation from Kasuto's work, the letter /jhete/, which he romanized as \<jh\>, has been adapted to /zhete/ which is romanized as \<zh\>. At this point, Jerin is making no other changes to the romanization of individual Hylian consonants. In addition to this, Jerin has modified vowel writing as follows:

1. Modified or _asènta_ vowels use a grave marking, \<\`\> rathan an acute \<´\> accent mark.
2. Diphthongs are written plainly, with no additional markings.
3. The glottal stop, or a break between vowels, is represented by the diaresis or umlaut mark \<¨\> over the vowel after it. Thus, \<hairule\> would be distinct from \<haïrule\>. For simplicity, this my be replaced with an apostrophe \<'\> in the break position if an _asènta_ vowel is required.

A more complete discussion of the phonology and phological processes of Modern Hylian will be reserved for the next chapter, which discusses the alphabet and the sounds represented by each letter.

## Phonology

In Hylian, each letter or digraph has only one reading. In the next section, the Hylian letters will be introduced along with their names, and their forms and how to type them using any font from the Hylian family (several download links will be provided, both to Kasuto's original fonts, and a set of new, custom fonts created for Jerin's update). For the remainder of this guide, you will see two types of Hylian text:

_fonte hilana_ will be used to represent font-based typographic spellings. If that text just says "fonte hilana," worry not: that just means you don't have a Hylian font available. Such text is case sensitive, with Capital letters represening different sounds than lower-case letters.

This guide may eventually be rendered in e-book formats, and some may not support custom fonts, but you can always find a PDF version of this guide as well. For the sake of typesetting, this guide is produced using a brand new Hylian font, which should fit smoothly alongside of the English text.

Alongside the Hylian font, the official transcriptions will be provided for all Hylian text. However, after a careful analysis of the language, I have made a few stylistic choices which are not consistent with Kasuto's transcriptions:

+ Transliterated diphthongs are no longer represented with a dot between the vowels. Though diphthongs are two vowels connected by a hook beneath them in the Hylian language, Kasuto treats the diphthongs as single letters, the Hylian font does the same, and there do not appear to be any significant instances of monophthong strings that match the diphthong contruction. As a result, I feel it appropriate to represent diphthongs as the component vowels, and to note non-diphthong constructions with an apostrophe, representing a glottal stop.
+ Though it is not written as a letter, the glottal stop has a phonemic value in Hylian. In the example of äktriu, the glottal stop occurs as follows: äktri'u. For the purposes of this guide, the diaresis \<¨\> above a vowel, or the apostrophe \<'\> between two vowels (and the Hylian ' in Hylian text) will be used to represent all glottal stops -- any place where an explicit glottal stop must be inserted. It will still be used in the positions Kasuto used it, to indicate genitive or possessive suffixes, but this new use will be used to clarify pronunciations, especially where vowel sequences occur, as in vise'Ere (vise'ëre). Vowels which do not have a glottal stop marker between them are diphthongs. The apostrophe will also be used to clarify boundaries between consonants.
+ Finally, though no word in the pre-existing lexicon from Kasuto uses the letter /khate/ (\<x\>), this letter will be represented in transliteration by the letter \<x\>, and mapped to both the letter \<x\> and the capital \<K\> in any new Hylian fonts.
