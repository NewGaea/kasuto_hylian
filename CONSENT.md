On 2016-Feb-13 contributor _[Austin Springer](austin-springer.md)_ received permission from original creator _Kasuto of Kataan_ to mirror and update the _Hylian Language Institute_ contents. While Austin didn't finish their objective, and they have passed the task onto the Hylian Linguistic Society, Austin is still a contributor.

> [!NOTE] Kasuto's Permission
> As far as the Hylian language goes, I haven't done any work on that for at least a decade. But I'm always open to new additions or work. I really don't have the time to do anything for it right now. I'm all for a mirror if you want to do the work. Knock yourself out. You can repost anything you want as long as proper credit it \[sic] given.

As (a) Austin remains a contributor and (b) we intend to give thorough credit to all of Kasuto's work, we maintain that the permission granted to Austin includes our assistance.
