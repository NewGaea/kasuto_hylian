# Hylian Community Wordlist
---
The following is a truncated archive of a thread (helpfully called _"Suggest New Words"_) in which community members of the Vinculum suggested and discussed words to fill in gaps left by Kasuto's documentation. The biggest contributor was **Venus, Queen of Faeries** and her presumed partner, **K-Chan.** **K-Chan** did not have an account of her own, and all of her contributions are listed within posts from **Venus.** Several other people also came up with quite a few words, rivalling **Venus and K-Chan** over the course of the thread.

There are various interjections by the previous maintainer of this archival documentation, **Austin Springer,** reflecting their thoughts as they produced and archived this data between 2017 and 2021, before they passed the torch to **Jerin of Calatia** in 2023. **Jerin** may add her own thoughts throughout this archive.

I'm copying my post from St. Patrick's Day.... maybe it'll inspire someone.

**trèowe** (TREH-oh-way; not to be confused with troe): Old English for faithful. Modern English: trust. Hylian suggestion: trust. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**trèowag** (TREH-oh-wahg): to trust. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**potëra** (poh-TEH-rah): Hylian suggestion: strong. Latin: "potere" was "potent." I just changed the ending to make it an adjective. Modern English: power. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**geleáfae** (Gay-lay-AH-fah-ay): Old English: "geleafa" was "belief." Changed ending to noun. Modern English: belief. Hylian suggestion: belief. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**geleafag** (Gay-lay-AH-fahg): to believe. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**luberag** (loo-BAY-rahg): Latin: "lubere" was "to please." Hylian suggestion: to please. **✅ 25-May-2021**

**malanmale** (Mah-lahn-MAH-lay) or **mámale** (MAH-mah-lay): million. Derived from "malan malën," or "a thousand thousands." I like "mámale" better because it's shorter, and it's got the accent mark, which would make it an exception to the "rule" of no accent marks (save the ë) in numbers. Exceptions are good. **✅ 25-May-2021**

First of all, I gotta give **[K-Chan](contributors/k-chan)** all the credit in the world for this, because if she didn't say anything to me, I wouldn't be about ready to burst right now. So, moka aroti, K-chan'kumi!

Down to business.

K-Chan'kumi said she was bored, so she made up a couple of words in Hylian. They were mostly for clothes, and they all had the letters "ok" in them. She told me "shirt" would be "**soke**."

> **soke** (SOH-kay): shirt **✅ 25-May-2021**

Meanwhile, I was looking at my blog, which happens to have a picture of Link on it. He's shooting an arrow. I wondered to myself, "Well, how would you say tunic? A tunic is like a big shirt...." I don't know how, but I instantly thought that instead of words, there should be a prefix to indicate size (not suffixes, because those indicate parts of speech). I thought of "**ma**" for "big" and "**dën**" for "small." Therefore, a tunic would be "**masoke**," or literally, "big shirt." (A baby-doll tee, on the other hand, would be a dënsoke.)

> AS: I'm thinking that while these could be valid words, the Hylian concept of a shirt and tunic are probably similar enough to both be _soke_

Also, the more you say the prefix, the more you exaggerate the size. Like mamamasoke would be a REALLY big shirt. On top of that, the size is relative. Little Link's tunic would still be called a masoke, because it's a big shirt to him, but if Adult Link were to try and squeeze his way into clothes he wore seven years ago, his head would get stuck inside the dënsoke.

> AS: I do like this, especially if the _last_ intensifier in a sequence is forced to carry primary stress for the word

K-chan'kumi also thought up a few more words: Leggings (**nonoke**), undergarments (**usheoke**), boots (**kamoke**), gloves (**namoke**). I told her she forgot "hat," but I came right up with that one: "**chapoke** (can't wait for that CH letter!)," from the French chapeau. **✅ 25-May-2021**

Something was wrong, though. The undergarments didn't look right to me. I thought perhaps there should be a way to tell men's undergarments from women's undergarments, because they're not quite the same, lol.

This is where I got my inspiration. "_Dege_" is Hylian for "deity." We change "_dege_" to "_dégine_" for "goddess" and to "_dégile_" for "god." We have "_kímino•i_" for "little girl" and "_kímilo•i_" for "little boy." Obviously, the N and the L are for girls and boys, respectively. I thought, why not make the N and L prefixes, too? Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "**nusheoke**" for "girls' underclothes" and "**lusheoke**" for "boys' underclothes." "**Usheoke**" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "**dënnusheoke**" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::

Of course, there are two SMALL problems with what I've done.... One: the double n in "_**dënnusheoke**_." Every letter in Hylian is supposed to be pronounced. How do you pronounce two Ns in a row? Two: the N and L prefixes only work for nouns that start with a vowel. What about the ones that start in consonants? I was thinking an apostrophe might work, but then again, it might not. "**N'kamoke**" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

But, that's what we've come up with. What do you guys think?

Now that I've slept on it, it probably makes more sense to make them **usheokile** and **usheokine** as opposed to the way I had it. Thanks, **[OniGanon](contributors/oniganon)**. It cures the double N problem, in (with) **dënusheokine**. I *was* trying to go for something different, though.... I didn't quite want it to be like _dégile/dégine_ or _piántile/piántine,_ because underwear aren't people, lol. **✅ 25-May-2021**

## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

You know, I just realized how well my words work together, and it was totally unintentional....

I suggested "**mámale**" for million, and then I later said that "**ma-**" should be a prefix for "big." "**Mámale**" would (could) be short for "_malan malën_" (AS: it would probably actually be _male do male_ ) or it could be "big _male_." Either way, it works. Nifty, ne?

## Venus: Queen of Faeries writes:

Family terms (inspired because I was reviewing this thread and found there are no terms for family AND because I'm writing a fic called Family Ties, which includes some very interesting family relationships....):

Just wondering if kímilo•i and kímino•i are only used as forms of address. Probably, since they end in I.

> AS: This is a good observation -- it is likely generic "boy" and "girl" words can be derived backwards from this, since the -il and -in gender suffixes are both present. Back-derivation suggests _kime_ for child, _kímile_ for boy, and _kímine_ for girl. **✅ 25-May-2021**

But, um, suggestions for "son" and "daughter" if those are only terms of address: "hiósile" for son (or boy) and "hiósine" for daughter (or girl), with "hiose" for just a regular old child. So "bagu'san hiósilën" would be "my boys," which would probably be understood as "my sons."

Here, I've got some more now that you're nice and warmed up and in my groove:

* Source: Merriam-Webster OnLine
  * PARENT, _piante_: _piántine_, _piántile_ (_piantën_) [Kasuto's original]
  * CHILD, **hiose**: **hiósine**, **hiósile** (**hiosën**) From Greek _hyios_, for son. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * SIBLING, **sipe**: **sípine**, **sípile** (**sipën**) From Old German _sippa_, for kinship. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * GRANDCHILD, **napete**: **napétine**, **napétile** (**napetën**) From Sanskrit _napAt_, for grandson. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * SPOUSE, **ipae**: **ipáine**, **ipáile** (**ipaën**) From Hittite _sipant_- for spouse. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * UNCLE/AUNT, **amite**: **amítine**, **amítile** (**amitën**) From Latin _amita_, for aunt. **✅ 25-May-2021**
* Source: Me. I study languages. o.o
  * GRANDPARENT, **sofe**: **sófine**, **sófile** (**sofën**) From Japanese _sofu_, for grandfather. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * COUSIN, **itoke**: **itókine**, **itókile** (**itokën**) From Japanese _itoko_, for cousin. **✅ 25-May-2021**
  * NEPHEW/NIECE, **sobre**: **sóbrine**, **sóbrile** (**sobrën**) From Spanish _sobrino_, for nephew. **✅ 25-May-2021**

Great- (as in great-grandfather or great-aunt): _ma'_ (so that great-grandfather would be "masófile") From my previous suggestion for "big."
Half- (as in half-sister): _dëna'_ (so that half-sister would be "dënasípine") From my previous suggestion for "little." I'm changing "little/small" from "dën" to "dëna" since it's an adjective, and all adjetives must end in A.
Note: "ma" and "dëna" in these cases would not mean "big" or "little," but indicate more of a hierarchy of terms. "**Dënasípine**," then, would not mean "little sister" or "younger sister", but rather "half sister", indicating that one is not as close to a half sister as a full sister. Similarly, "**masófile**" would not indicate one's elder grandfather, but rather, someone older THAN one's grandfather, who should be one's grandfather's father, or one's great-grandfather. Don't worry about it if I've confused you. It's just one of those weird things about language. Trust me when I say that it makes perfect sense in my head. But if you do understand it, then good for you! You can help me explain it to others! ^_^

> AS: It really is a nice idea, but I'm not 100% certain I want to go exactly this way. I'll review this once the community wordlist is finalised.

Step- (e.g., stepfather): **ipa'** ✅ (stepfather is "ipapiántile") From "**ipae**", previously mentioned to mean "spouse." "**Ipapiántile**" would have a literal translation as "spouse-father," which could be interpreted as a father-by-marriage, which is precisely what a stepfather is. I suppose it could also refer to inlaws, and differentiated by context. Haven't exactly worked this one out.

> AS: I love this one, though, it's a great way to distinguish blood relations from legal ones!

So what do you all think? :::grins proudly:::

## Venus: Queen of Faeries writes:

Just like I promised last month in "Is there a Hylian letter for C?" topic, the list of words **KChan** and I made up. There aren't very many, but I hope it helps. I also have the complete list of Hylian words **[Kasuto](contributors/kasuto)** made up, in case anyone wants it, and a list of words we should probably tackle first, suggestion-wise. Without further ado:

* Undergarment -- **usheoke** ✅
* Yellow -- **hia** ✅

One more thing, and this is for Kasuto:
I was looking through the HLI pages, trying to get a list of ALL the words (including ones I missed. You'll be pleased to know you've got nearly 300 words, not counting what's in the dictionary! :D But I digress), and I ran across a couple that were repeated, but had different meanings in Hylian and I was wondering if you could clear them up for me.

This/That/These/Those: I found a BUNCH of words for those four, like _za, zan, zata, zatan, zu, ziu, zatu_ and _zatiu_. The only conclusion I could draw was that you decided to change the words halfway through and didn't change it on ALL of the pages, so I'm sort of confused as to which means what.

> AS: Pronouns ending in _a_ are demonstratives, as in "_za lërde_ => that book" while pronouns ending in _u_ are independent pronouns, as in "_zu tairas bagu'sa lërde_ => that is my book"

To Write: Two words have come up, _kakirag_ and _katabag_.

Ordinal numbers: Take the stem and add "_-ashe_" for the noun, "_-asha_" for the adjective. I understand that. You have "fourth book" as "_koshasa lërde_" and I'm wondering if that's a mistake and it should be "_koasha lërde_."

> AS: Actually, it should be _kosasha_ -- the s is dropped for _-dëme_ and _-sale_ due to an undescribed phonological process that dislikes consonant clusters.

Thanks a lot. ^_^;;

New word: **këwle** ✅ for fish. Olua made it up, not me. It was actually the result of a typo. Anyway, it's pronounced "KEHW-lay." Um, if that's sort of difficult to figure out (cuz it looks that way), it's like "keh-oo-lay," but the first two syllables become one.

I think that it's sort of difficult to pronounce at first, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. If not, I offer "ka•ule" (COW-lay) and "kèule" (KEH-oo-lay) as alternates.

## [emekthian](contributors/emekthian) writes:

You can pronounce 2 n's in a row. There are plenty of languages that even make a distinction between, say "kanor" and "kannor". Just because a word is hard for someone used to speaking English doesn't mean it's impossible to pronounce.

Anyway, some words:

**hraiäte** - praise ✅
**shoyanne** - explosive ✅
**ktaniyuhrozag** - to exasperate

## Venus, Queen of Faeries responds:

^_^ The Goddesses must have heard my prayers last night when I complained that no one ever posts in this section, so thank you, emekthian!

As for double letters, I looked over my collection of words Kasuto has made up and found no double letters. Maybe it's just something that doesn't happen in Hylian?

One more thing about making up a language: ease of pronunciation. So, if you don't mind, could you explain exactly HOW one would pronounce the words you've made up because I can't seem to do it.

---
## emekthian responds:

* hraiäte- hr-eye-at-ey /AS: _raiät_ ✅ or _harät_ seems like a reasonable form that feels consistent with Kasuto's lexicon/
* shoyanne- sh-oh-yahn-ney /AS: _shoyane_ ✅ seems reasonable enough since Hylian does not have any official long consonants/
* ktaniyuhrozag- ktah-nee-you-hroh-zahg /AS: Yeah, uh, Hylian certainly lacks several of these. Let's shuffle the letters a bit: _tanikyurozag_ ✅ the only dropped letter is the _h_./

"hr" is like the "hy" sound in "huge", only with a "r" instead of a "y".

I admit the "kt" is hard to pronounce. But it can be done!

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

Hmm. A little difficult, but I bet I can knock them off with practice.

Okay, I've got a couple of more words, too. Inspired by a little speech I plan to have a character making in the future:

**mo•iag** (MOY-ahg): to hear, to listen. (And note that it includes the "o•i" letter (o•ite), which is NOT listed in the alphabet, but used in the particle "sho•i.") I took the Spanish "oír," for "hear" and part of "comprendar." I would have used more of "comprendar" but I was also planning to use "kiku," Japanese for "to listen to." Then I remembered that there were way more words that started with K than any other letter, so I scrapped the whole thing. Mo•iag was the result. ✅

**mejag** (MEH-jahg): to resemble, to look like. Taken from Spanish "asemejarse," to resemble. ✅

**zavokag** (zah-VOH-kahg): to know, to understand. Taken from French "savoir," to know. I changed the S to a Z because every time I said it, it came out that way. :p There's also a K from the Japanese "wakaru," to know. I can't seem to stay away from those Japanese Ks, can I? LOL. ✅

---
## OniGanon observes:

Hmm... one thing about Kasuto's Hylian is that the words are usually pretty easy to pronounce. It's a bit like Japanese, in that it doesn't often have two consonants in a row. So sounds like hr and kt, while possible, don't fit so well with Kasuto's Hylian.

Of course this is just my opinion. It's up to Kasuto of course.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

One more suggestion: Blowing people off.

Most interjections seem to end in i, and blowing someone off (don't ask why I thought of it, this stuff just pops up in my head), seems like something one might need. Something to say a sarcastic "yeah, right," scoff, or just plain old "pssssh."

I suggest "**jhi**." Monosyllabic, two letters, and it's not difficult to pronounce. AND, it uses the not-too-often used JH letter. ^_^

And tongue twisters! Don't know why I was thinking about that either, but along with the words K-Chan and I made up, there's already a simple one: "_siafirën sian_." (Blue sapphires.) Say it five times fast. Betcha mess up. :p

## [Link Æwondåslåmon](contributors/link_æwondåslåmon) rebuts:

That's a very interesting language, emekthian, though I've always imagined the Kokiris speaking a much more beautiful language, without any uvular sound. :roll: I've never thought of making an own language for the Kokiris. In my fan fics they're speaking ancient Hylian, my own version of Hylian. :) The text below is written in my Hylian. In that language there are no uvular sounds, only beautiful sounds (might be because I only like beautiful sounds and don't wanna make a language that elves would think of as distasteful). :) But, you've done a great job.

---
## emekthian rebuts:

Are you saying that uvular sounds are ugly?! Because I've killed people for making lesser derisions against sounds! :)

I happen to like uvulars, and so I say the Gágïrhi (Kokiri) do too.

---
## Link Æwondåslåmon defends:

I meant that ELVES thinks that it's ugly, and (I might have read too much Tolkien) I just didn't want to create a language that elves would think of as distasteful, though I'm not that fond of uvular sounds as well. Yeah, I know I'm weard. I'm speaking uvular r's myself. :mrgreen: Anyways, when we see the nature they live in, I don't think uvular sounds in their language would be likely :roll: , but it's your language.

Notice the part I put in bold. See the relation? And since KChan has said that clothes should have "ok" in them, if we took that out and added and E to the end, we should have the related body parts. :::nod:::

So, foot would be **kame**, hand would be **name**, head -\> **chape**, chest -\> **se** (remember, a tunic is a "big shirt."

## Venus, Queen of Fairies indulges:

Yes, it's very in-depth. Just like any other language. And it's nowhere NEAR completion; the stuff you see in this topic isn't even "official," I just like to help out and suggest words. Whether my suggestions are taken or not is something different, but it's good to help, you know?

I saw the HLI updated for the first time in almost THREE MONTHS, so I had to take a look. I was slightly disappointed to see that it was only a comment, but I got over myself and started looking over my work. I got a teeeeeeeny bit of inspiration and two (four?) new vocabulary words.

There's this problem that's been plaguing me for a year. Underwear. :::laughs::: If you've read the topic, then you know what I'm talking about. If not, well, bear with me.

KChan made up the word for undies, usheoke. Fantastic. I took it and ran.

> **Venus, Queen of Faeries wrote:**

Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "nusheoke" for "girls' underclothes" and "lusheoke" for "boys' underclothes." "Usheoke" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "dënnusheoke" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::

I ran into a couple of problems, though:

"N'kamoke" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

I came up with a solution I didn't like:

I *was* trying to go for something different, though.... I didn't quite want it to be like dégile/dégine or piántile/piántine, because underwear aren't people, lol.

And left it at that. I later changed "dën" to "dëna" since "small" is an adjective. "Dën'" would be used as the prefix if the next word started with a vowel, and "dëna" if it started with a consonant, or if there were another prefix. I was thinking that since I mentioned N and L, I could use that for gender itself. Simply, "ne" and "na" for "female" and "le" and "la" for male ("female" and "male" can be either a noun or an adjective, depending on usage; mostly adjectives). With that done, the underwear problem is solved. "Dënusheokine" ceases to exist because the "in" at the end implies the noun is a sentient being, and underwear most certainly is not.

> **Austin Springer analyses:**
> 
> I strongly disagree with your assumption that the -il and -in suffixes imply sentience or personhood -- they may be used to mark a semantic gender, but even a semantic gender can be a gender based on association rather than literal sex. Just think about terms like "man-bun" or "boyshorts" -- both of these have a semantic gender even though neither the bun nor shorts involved have a physical gender.

Similarly to "dën'-" and "dëna-", "na" and "la" would be apostrophized (is that a word? I can't find a dictionary that has a verb "to apostrophe") if the word it was describing started with a vowel. When used in conjunction, "small" would be "dëna-", because both "na" and "la" start with consonants, so good thing for that; there won't be apostrophes all over the place. "Lingerie," then, becomes "Dënan'usheoke." Man-thongs (ew?), "dënal'usheoke." "Ma" would not have this rule. That's what we call irregular, folks.

WHEW. I hope you got all that.

One more thing. I thought:

I think "Ushe" works better as the word for "crotch". Woohoo, more irregularities! It doesn't need to be broken down into gender, because I think that would be understood, given the person in question. And we've got words for male and female now, besides.

There need to be more words with the complex letter sounds, like a•ite and such. And irregularities! Irregularities (even though Hylian is mostly regular) still need to exist, and they're fun because you can confuse people with them!!

Okay, I'm done for now. Sorry, everyone. ^_^;;

## Venus, Queen of Faeries notes:

I've got it documented... actually, I've got a huge chart of all of Kasuto's words in alphabetical order (English alphabet, anyway), then color coded for what part of speech it is.... Underneath that, I've got mine and KChan's words, and the ones we thought up together, organized the same way... I don't think I have anyone else's, though.

## Venus, Queen of Fairies explains:

It came to me when I was at work on Friday... someone was wearing a jacket for Montclair Hockey. Montclair is in New Jersey, btw. So then I thought "Mont clair" means "clear mountain" in French. And then I thought "mot" (pronounced like Moe, the bartender on The Simpsons). means "word" in French. And then I thought, there's no word for word in Hylian. So, I didn't want it to be too close to the French mot, so mont is was. Monte to make it a noun.

Yup, I still think about this stuff. I just want it to continue SO BADLY.... and I wish there were more people interested in this. ;-;

Today: body parts! We've already got eyes and arms ("Vosu'san opjhën sha•i va•isas ab nosu ëk Vosu'san brinstën da•ia amkane sha•i witas ab nosu" no, that wasn't from memory and no, I'm not a dork), and I suggested a few more (foot, head and others), but there are still some we don't have. Until now.

Ear - hizaze ✅
Nose - isue ✅
Mouth - muntha•ize ✅
Hair - serise ✅
Heart - chepaye ✅
Face - andwe ✅
Finger - aikwe ✅
Toe - adakae ✅ (from aikwe da•ia kame; fingers of the foot -- real original, I know -- kame having been previously suggested for foot.)

A note about serise: The singular is used to mean one strand of hair; the hair on your head would be serisën. Like the French cheveux. That means 'hair', but it's plural, because you've got more than one hair on your head. You would say "Mes cheveux sont..." "My hairs are..." unlike the English "My hair is..."

Here are some nouns that you can play with if you feel like it:
batyahe, pete.

And a new nounverb: kiss: magze, magzag. ✅

I'm done now. You may continue skipping over the post/thread/forum.

## [Pata Hikari](contributors/pata_hikari) notes:

I'm surprised nobody's put this foreword.

Katene Lasta - Master Sword.

**Katene** - Sword, based off the japanese word katana

**Lasta** - Master, ruler, best, etc. Invented in my mind ✅

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries replies:

Well, there's already a word for sword (it's kishoke) but your other suggestion is awesome. And welcome to the forums! :::offers a potted plant with a big fuschia bow:::

...perhaps we can use katene for something else.

---
## Pata Hikari wonders:

Maybe katene can be used for a type of sword?

I mean, in english there's rapier, saber, etc.

Katene could mean broadsword, which is what the Master Sword is. While kishoke could be the generic word. ✅

> AS: I like the idea, but _broadsword_ is actually a word that eans nothing in historical terms -- it could be a bastard sword, though, which is a sword suitable for use in either one or two hands.

---

## Venus, Queen of Faeries muses:

Perhaps... but then we've got to make up all the sword-words while there are still plenty of other words that don't have... words. Like... mouse. Or something. You know?

> **Austin Springer muses:**
> 
> not at all! The main reason we have so many sword words isn't because of simply having many designs over the years, but many languages that we borrowed names from for their more unique designs. If Hyrule only has a few types of swords, they may only have a few words for them!

---
## Pata Hikari offers:

Mouse?

Heh, got a word for that!

**Matre** Mouse ✅

**Lupe** Dog, from the latin word Lupis ✅

**Zenre** Animal ✅

## Venus, Queen of Faeries whispers:

<3_<3 I love you.

---
## Pata Hikari offers:

I came up with this word while writing a fanfic. ^^

**Thente** Death. From the Greek word Thantos(sp? /thanatos/) also meaning death. ✅

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries accepts:

**Thentag** - to die. ^_^ Good job, Pata. ✅

---
## [SoloWolf](contributors/solowolf) chimes in:

Hmmmm
Well as a former latin student I have a few
Gladius=Sword
Patrus=father
Victore=To conquer
Polutus=chicken(cucoo)

/These words are not gramamtical, but could be massaged into usable forms/

> AS: All of your suggestions step on the toes of either official words or obvious borrowings from the games, as Venus points out below. I hope you are able to make some contributions, though!

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries explains:

There are already words for sword, father AND conquer (they're kishoke, piántile and ushikag, respectively). Besides, you don't want the words to be too close to any real language (living or dead).

> AS: This is not necessarily true -- cognates, and false cognates, are a real phenomenon, so having some words close to prior languages, and even having a meaning that sounds similar, is not a huge problem. Just look at _toëre_ v. _tierra_ or _kisame_ v. _kisame_ -- even the numbers show a strong PIE bias.

---
## Link Æwondåslåmon re-iterates:

There could be words for different kinds of swords, though.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries smiles:

^____^

You make my mornings happy, BBB.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries observes:

Oops. Forgot one teeny thing. All nouns must end in -e, so órod's gotta be **órode**. Is that okay? I liked how you used Pata Hikari's suggestion for death, too. ^_^

I hope Kasuto does come back and adds all these suggestions to the official language. Together, in this topic, we've created 92 words!!! And the list of words we need is growing, too. It's aliiiiiiiiiiive!!!

* Clothing (shirt, pants, skirt, jacket)
* Emotional/Physical conditions (sad, angry, alone, wet, injured, cold)
* Superlatives (e.g., high/higher/highest)

---
## BBB gratefully nods:

I don't mind at all that an e must be added. It further distances it from the Greek word which is desireable if you want to make the Hylian language individual.

However I do think the words:
Cuccos, Keese, guays,and teketites should be considered Hylian words because there is no possible translation into English. (Except perhaps giant, jumpey' one eyed bug type creature and peck out the eyes bird.)
I also thougt that a good word for skeleton would be stal, as in the stal in stalfos. And perhaps fos could be added to somethings name as a term of fear, like skeleton-monster or wolf-monster (wolfos). Although there could be a word for both already in Kasutos dictionary.

> AS: I agree, Hylian words presented in the games, including monster names, should generally be considered and adapted with minimal distortion.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries grins:

Well, they are... their spellings just need to be modified a teeny bit to fit Kasuto's grammar rules. I only copied things verbatum [sic]; I didn't touch anything (though I added batyahe as a word for valley. I think that sounds pretty cool. Think you could use it, OniGanon?).

### BBB wrote:

Oooh, I like that. It's so amazingly simple. Stale for skeleton (remember, nouns end in -e), fose for fear, and maybe fosa for afraid? There's no word for wolf... but there's a word for dog.

---
## BBB agrees:

Yes, that sounds very good to me.

Stale: Skeleton ✅

Fose: Fear, added to a somethings name to suggest that it is to *be* feared. ✅

Fosa: Afraid ✅

This language is evolving a lot is'nt [sic] it?

---
### Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

I guess a faerie flew around this section and gave it a couple more hearts. ^_^;;

So, I'm still working on that huge list of vocabulary that Kasuto made up. I went through all the pages of the Hylian Language Institute with a fine-toothed comb (again), picking up any words I could find. Turns out, there are over a hundred words that are not included in the dictionary.

I'm taking it upon myself to write up a new dictionary for the HLI, with all those words included. When I'm done, I'll upload it as a .txt file. The upside of this is that you can get to it -- all the words at once -- whenever you want. The downside of this is that the Hylian font will not be included (since you can only have one style of text in a .txt file), and the parts of speech will not be italicized. If you want the .doc file that I'm writing, which will include all of that, you can PM me when I'm finished. I'll also be making a version that includes our suggestions. However, I won't be uploading that. I'll be updating it constantly to keep up with the changes that we make in this thread, so if you'd like that at any time, you can PM me for that, too. That'll be available as either a .txt file or a .doc file, whatever you want. ^_^

---
## Magnas requests:

When you're done that, maybe you could make it into an HTML file that will include all that, if you're capable? It may help you sort it out. Just a suggestion for now  :D I don't have anything else to add, since I'm not really capable of suggesting new words ATM. If you don't know HTML, I can use it as practice once you're done and try to do that for you (once I understand the language and all).

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries agrees:

Well, I do know HTML (I used to webmistress my marching band's site), but I'll give it to you for practice anyway. ^_^

Edit: The HLI .txt file is complete! You can find it here [http://www.kasuto.net/uploads/HLI.txt](http://www.kasuto.net/uploads/HLI.txt). The .doc file is also available.

Editedit: Our additional words are available in both .txt and .doc files. Hurray! ^_^

---
## Blues Brother ponders:

Hmmm... Since Skeleton is Stale... Should we maybe name the different bones? Or maybe just like.... The major limbs... I don't know, I just thought I might drop a suggestion for a new word...

Hey no word for wolf, but who knows, maybe they meant wolfos to be the word for wolf? XD

Do not make me get critcised, I am no good at words. XD Not different languages anyway... Anyway.... What ARE some words you do not have?? Do you have one for Dragon? If you do not.... Shenro or something along those lines might work... (I like dragons. XD Especially serpentine ones. XD The Shenron, or Dragon Gods. XD Like Volvagia. XD)

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries offers:

Here's a incomplete list of what we need:

* Directions (up, down, left, right, forward, back, compass points)
* Common creatures (cuccos, keese, guays, tektites)
* Geographical features (mountains, valleys)
* Weather (rain, snow)
* Anatomy (head, shoulders, knees, toes)
* Clothing (shirt, pants, skirt, jacket)
* Emotional/Physical conditions (sad, angry, alone, wet, injured, cold)
* Superlatives (e.g., high/higher/highest)

We *do* have some of these things... like rain, head, shoe, you know. But ifyou could just list things, we'll either take them or assign the word to something else (if the English word you chose to translate is already translated).

---
## Blues Brother requests:

Okie dokie.... Do we have the planets? Like Mars? Could be...Marisia? Or Marsio? I don't know.... - -;;

Spirit?

Vile-A vile, like for water... /AS: vial/

Vile-as in Vile, not a vile...

Poison

Snake

Evil

Colours-Red, blue, black, ect..

Music-Rock, Jazz, Hip hop, Rap, Country, Flamingo, J Rock, J Pop, German Rock, Hard Rock, Grunge... Any others?

Sorry, am no good at thinking up words to translate them too... Sorry again... - -;;

---
## Venus, Queen of Fairies moans:

:/

Not to sound mean or anything... but I thought you were going to help make up words... not list more words that we don't have.

---
## Blues Brother dodges:

I am going to help, but I listed them so I can look for them when I want to try and think of things to translate them to Hylian... I mean.... I listed some of the words I wanted to get translated, so I would not forget them, then, you guys might beat me to the punch... Or maybe just... I don't know. I am searching for something for spirit right now... I am not THAT lazy.

EDIT:

supiritto,
seirei,
iki,
seishou,
shinzui,
konjou


Those are Japanese for Spirit, I shal look for others now. X3 I am just getting a bases for the Hylian words, later I shall add the little parts like the e after vowels... or however that rule went...


EDITEDIT: Found Rock... Found an online Japanese dictionary. XD I love the japanese language. XD Will look for latin next. Promise. XD


yurasu,
yusaburu,
yusuburu,
iwa,
rokku,
ganseki

EDITEDITEDIT: Nevermind, here, I'llpost the dictionary site too. X3 HAs lotsa languages, not just Japnese. X3

## emekthian suggests:

How about using the suffix -zwa as a superlative, and not having a comparative at all? E.G. nasunazwa, "darkest" or "darker".

> AS: I see the idea you're going for here, but I actually think we can simply use _Venus'_ augmentative and dimiunitive prefixes as comparatives like so:
>
> * dëne-: a smaller or lesser amount
> * mahe-: a larger or greater amount

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries observes:

I'm dumb... I didn't see the bit about not having comparitives at all. So yeah, that could work... me gusta.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries adds:

Four new words!

akonde - sky **archived 27 May 2021** ✅
miare - vision **archived 27 May 2021** ✅
na•imre - dream **archived 27 May 2021** ✅
na•ipe - wish **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

And with that, I have the verse from the Book of Mudora in the LttP manual. There's a topic around, so I'll post it there.

---
## Pata Hikari offers:

I have some new words! These came to me.

Nede Doctor **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

Nedag Treating the sick **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

> **Austin Springer thinks:**
> 
> Nice, but a simple suggestion: _nede_ should be medicine or potions, and _nedase_ would be "one who treats the sick", as _kriashag_ is "to create" and _kriashase_ (simple present tense, re-inflected into a noun) is "creator"

Lune Shadow/Darkness Would be used in the context of the element, such as Emplae Lune **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

Emplae A church, temple, or general place of worship **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

What do you think?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries reflects:

We have shadow and darkness already.... unless you mean lune to be used ONLY as the element (and nasuna NEVER to be used for the element), not like "I don't have a shadow cuz the sun went behind a cloud." But then we'd have to get special words for the other five elements, too. That could be interesting, actually.

The other suggestions are great, too, of course. I'll add those to the dictionary post-haste. (Post-haste is a cool word.)

---
## [Slacker](contributors/slacker) facetiously suggests:

Illidan :Storm.

Yeah... that is about it.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries sincerely accepts:

If you don't mind, I'm gonna stick an E on the end of that to make it a noun, and take out one of the Ls because there are no double letters in Hylian (aside from just two words). Thanks a lot!

/ilidane "storm"/ **archived 27 May 2021** ✅

---
## Pata Hikari submits:

Yeah, I meant it /lune/ to be only used as the Element /shadow/.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries muses:

Okay, so now we need special words for forest, fire, water, spirit and light. Not to mention regular words for forest, spirit and light. ^_^;;

---
## Pata Hikari winks:

Way ahead of ya. ;)

* **Solan** Light Element ✅
* **Perlun** Fire Element ✅
* **An** Water Element /* AS: I don't like this one as it feels too short even after giving it the standard inflections. **Auwën** ✅ seems closer even to the rest of your elemtnal words */
* **Molorn** Forest Element ✅
* **Hevon** Spirit Element ✅
* **Galen** Earth Element ✅
* **Silfan** Wind Element ✅

And a random word :D

* **Perin** Soul ✅

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries proposes:

\*\_\* Marry me! I see you even included Wind and Earth. How clever of you! (Perin could also double as the normal word for spirit!)

I was looking through the ooooooold Kas.net (thanks, Lysia!) and found the old Hylian Language. Well, not much has changed in three and a half years, but a few words did, most notably hello and good-bye. Hello used to be **_batá•í_** (bah-TIE), and now it's _oha•io_ (oh-HIGH-oh). Goodbye used to be **_jhënta•i_** (JHEHN-tie) and now it's _sajaná•í_ (Sah-jah-NIGH). (The words for fire and righteousness only changed by pronunciation and apostrophe, respectively.)

I like _batá•í_ and _jhënta•i_. We should use them for something, don't you think? (I actually like _batá•í_ for hello a lot better than _oha•io_.)

> AS: I agree -- I actually note that _batai_ seems more closely related to the still-current _bënkati_ used in greeting or welcoming people, so perhaps both of these words can be kept as traditional or formal ways say "hello" and "goodbye".

Normal words (non-elementals):

* forest - **mavlise** (mahv-LEE-say) ✅
* light - **rokèlzise** (roh-KEHL-zee-say) ✅
* to light (a candle or something): **rokèlzisag** - emekthian, look! I managed to incorporate a bit of one of your words! ✅
* earth - **bí•úkoge** (BYOO-koh-gay). Something I just made up with letters I felt weren't used enough. ✅
* wind - **fethe** (FAY-thay; rom Old Irish "feth", meaning "air") ✅

Oh, and I found a mistake in the .doc, Pata. I SWITCHED ënt and ont. Sorry about that!

---
## Pata Hikari thinks deeply:

I've been thinking, and I produced two new words.

**Lincre** Courage, the root for the Hylian name Linc ^_^;;

**Zeldne** Wisdom, the root word for the Hylian name Zelda : P

If either of these words have been made...well, the school filter is blocking my ascess to the dictionary :o

**Moldrme** The 'orginal' Hylian prounanation of the monster Moldorm

**Moblne** The 'Orginal' Hylian of the monster Moblin

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries sighs:

Wisdom is woeke, but your suggestion **lincre** is more creative than my **kurajhe**. ^_^

How would you pronounce those "original" words, if you don't mind?

---
## Pata Hikari attempts to explain:

* **Moblne**: Mo-bln-ay

* **Moldrme**: Mol-derm-ay

---
## Venus, Queen of Faires shrugs:

Oh, so normally-like, then?

---
## BBB composes:

_Mavlise Kokiri_ : Kokiri forest

_Daonkve hilana_: Lake Hylia

_Órod thente_: Death moutain

I plan on making a map using the Hylian place-names someday, I just need some more words. Good luck, I plan on contributing as soon as I have some good ideas.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries guides:

Just a quick correction: The word for Kokiri is **kokirne** ✅ and órod should have an E on the end. ^_^

---
## BBB stands corrected:

_Mavlise Kokirna_ /mavlise kokirna - this aligns name with Lake Hylia/

_Daonkve Hilana_

_Órode thente_ /Órode thenta - again, this aligns it with Lake Hylia/

Thanks for the correction!

---
## A wild [QBri](contributors/qbri) appears:

:D Hi there all. I'm a new poster (kind of), but I've followed the Hylian language closely and have decided to start to post here on the board.

Regarding the word "Ab": This basically shows a direct object, if I'm not mistaken. This is great for regular nouns, but to me I've always felt it was kind of awkward for personal pronouns, that's why I'm suggesting the following:

Direct & Indirect Objective Personal Pronouns:

* **më** (meh) - "me" used as the objective form of "bagu" 🛑
* **tau** - "you" objective form of "taiu" 🛑
* **në** - "us" 🛑
* **vë** - "you all" 🛑

ëru, sëru, and ru don't really need to change in my opinion. But like I said, I've always found it kind of awkward to add "ab" before a personal pronoun when it's in an objective state.

> **AS:** Simply put, this iteration of language doesn't really need these words, and it is explicitly stated in `asonën` that the pronouns _do not change forms based on role._ To add these to this iteration of Hylian is directly contrary to the intentions of Kasuto.

Examples of how they could be used:

Sëru miaras më. - "She sees me." or since the objective form can clarify who the "doer" in the sentence is, this allows the sentence structure to be flipped easily:
Më sëru miaras. - "Me she sees"

Diarans ru ank në - Give it to us.
Bagu amkanas tau - I love you.
Tau amkanas - "you loves" can be understood as "You I love"

Good idea? Bad idea? Just something I liked and thought I would share.
Thanks for any input.

-Q

## Venus, Queen of Faeries welcomes:

Hello and welcome to the forums, QBri!! ^_^

First of all, lemme blatantly suck up to you and say that I'm glad that (a) you've decided to post here first and (b) you know what you're talking about! I really do appreciate it.

I'm not saying you're right, and I'm not saying you're wrong, but maybe using the direct object particle before the pronoun like this is just one of those things about Hylian that's weird to foreigners. Personally, I accept a lot of that. Makes it more challenging and more fun, like it's really a real language. ^_^

> AS: The above statement reflects on my thoughts -- if anything, I would rather see these cases evolve in future forms of the language than be shoe-horned into Kasuto's "Modern" or "Era of Time" version.

Okay, now one quick (and small, painless) correction: "me" (in English) is still a pronoun, so its Hylian equivalent would have to end in -u. Same for you (your objective form already does, but I'm just pointing it out anyway), us and you all.

I wish I could discuss this in further detail with you, but I don't have all the answers (since I didn't make this up, after all). Keep posting, though! I'd like to hear more from you!

---
## The QBri uses Ret-Con:

Okay, here's what I've altered since I forgot about the "all pronouns end in -u" rule:

* me - **mëu** (meh-ooh) 🛑
* you - **tau** 🛑
* us - **nëu** 🛑
* you guys - **vëu** 🛑

If nobody has any objections with these forms then I'll go ahead and use them myself! Thanks for the comment Venus!

Ultimately, I dislike them, but would suggest that if they are incorporated, we simply make compounds with the particle: _ab bagu_ becomes _abagu_, _ab taiu_ becomes _abaiu_ or _adaiu_ (I like the idea of a phonological process responsible for shortening these compound words), _ab nosu_ becomes _amnosu_, _ab vosu_ becomes _avosu_, and then we may as well include _abru_, _absëru_, and _abëru_ plus their plural forms. This creates a table like so:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person</th>
    <th colspan=2>Singular</th>
    <th colspan=2>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Nominative</th>
    <th>Accusative</th>
    <th>Nominative</th>
    <th>Accusative</th>

## QBri waits patiently:

Hey I hate to double post, but I think these suggestions would go better in this topic:

Definite & Indefinite pronouns:

* _toka_ - all; _toke_ - everything (noun form of toka)
* **toa** - some; **toe** - something ✅
* **boka** - none; **boke** - nothing ✅

I could come up with factors for people (everyone, someone, etc.) and for time but I'll let someone else do it for now. I figured these would work out well because Venus just came up with the word toa.

2 other pronouns:

* **ala** - there ✅
* **aka** - here (from spanish aqui) ✅

Conjunction:
**sëk** - but ✅
**moa** (moh-ah) - also ✅

PREPOSITIONS
*side note* I really like the ambiguity of the word "ank," to me it works well almost a particle that marks the indirect object, (i.e.- it shows to whom/what/where the action is placed and thus can be used to mean "to, on, at, for") Thus, I suggest that "ank" be used as such and then we don't have to waste time memorizing other words for "for" or "at" (I'm aware that "ont" and "ënt" are already created and I think they should be used as normal) but in other instances where a indirect object needs to be marked, I personally think "ank" works well.*end side note*

* **tok** - with (from japanese "to") ✅

Other prepositions that need to be translated:
until, by, as, at (I think there's already a word for this but I can't remember), into, about, between, than, since...

That's all I got for now.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries wonders:

Merriam Webster Online (what I use to double check parts of speech) says here and there are adverbs. o_o I don't understand that, because you'd think "here" would take the place of "this place" and "there" would take the place of "that place", but maybe since "this" and "that" are adjectives, "here" and "there" MUST be adverbs. \@\_\@ Yay English. I really need to take some linguistics courses. What about a word for *way* over there? Can we have one of those? I like those.

> AS: You mean a word for _yonder_?

I don't understand the toka/toa/boka bit. What's with "all toke" "some toe" and "none boke"? Sorry.... But, if toka means all, and toa means some (boka means none, then?), everyone (everybody) would be all people, or tokan hitën. BUT, it's a pronoun, so it's got to end in -u, and tokan hitënu is kinda long, so if anyone's got an idea, great. Same for no one (nobody). Someone is different, though.

I could swear we already had a word for also.... but I agree with your note on prepositions. Let's just use ank for everything.

---
## QBri concurs:

That's really weird. The way I see it, Hylian is its own language, alien to our world's languages. So I think that we can count "here" and "there" as adjectives. But if you think it's better to have them as adverbs then we can do that. Either way is fine with me really.

Regarding "this" and "that":

In an earlier post someone wondered what was up with the 4 different words for this and that, and I thought I'd clear up any confusion:

In english, our words "this" and "that" work both as pronouns (i.e.- this is the best.) and as adjectives (this car is big.), but in Hylian, Kasuto created two separate pairs: "za" and "zata" are adjectives (thus for plurals they must have -n added to the end.) And "zu" and "zatu" are pronouns. For "zu" and "zatu" you must add an -i before the "u" to make them plural (i.e- ziu - these, zatiu - those)

Take a look:

_Za tinske tairas torima._ - _This work is finished._ (note that the adjective form of "this" is used to describe the work. And notice that "finished" is technically an adjective in this context and thust the verb "torimag" becomes the adjective "torima." In english howered, past tense verbs can act as adjectives so this seems odd to us. But it makes sense if you think about it. *end note)

_Zu tairas vinazwa._ - _This is best/better._ (This uses the pronoun "this" which takes the form of the subject. Remember that the pronoun forms can also be used as objective forms.) *side note - I'm assuming that the suffix -zwa is being accepted as the superlative/comparitive suffix. Thus it can be added like so.  :roll:

Guess that that's all for now.

Oh, by the way, I wanted to suggest the word "**upag**" for "_to pray._" ✅

And I guess that that is all....
Sajanai toka.

-Q

---
## Slacker needlessly offers:

**Vere**: Truth

Comes from the word Veritas. Which means truth.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries responds:

Kasuto himself has already made a word for truth. It's _veuarde_ (probably from the same root), and veuarda for "true".

(I don't sound rude, do I? I don't mean to. If I do, I'm sorry.)

Oh, I wasn't suggesting that we make them adverbs, I just use MW to doublecheck things when I'm unsure of what they are. We can keep them adjectives; it makes more sense to me that way.

Haha, that was me (I've since figured it out. I was just really slow on the uptake). But now everyone can know. Yay!!

Just one suggestion. How about bëu instead of mëu? Cuz all the objective forms start with the same letter as the unobjective ones, so.... In the meantime, I'll add all of the suggestions to the list, and if I have to change it, I'll do it later. We're coming up on 150 really quickly. ^_^

---
## QBri concedes:

I agree with everything you say Venus.

You're right, **bëu** /bëu/ 🛑 (don't wanna bother adding in the dots at the moment \[Austin Springer: added them for archival\]) does make more sense. Let's use it and I guess that that's all for now.

just as a reminder, here's the prepositions we got:

to, for - _ank_ /AS: Only in the sense of establishing an indirect object)
on, in - _ont_
in, at (used for time) - _ënt_
of - _daia_
from - _doia_
with - _**tok**_ ✅

some new ones:
until - **jade** (comb. of "gis"(esp.) and "made"(jap.) ✅
for (on behalf of) - **pro** ✅
than - **ol** (from esp. "ol") ✅

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries agrees:

Those are good suggestions, and I won't hesitate to add them once we figure out what to make them end in. (For those of you just joining us,) Hylian's a grammar-coded language, so we can't have prepositions like jade ending in E when singular nouns end in E. The other problem is that Hylian prepositions don't have a set ending.

That said, we need to pick one. For reference, this is our super-complete list of prepositions as we have them right now:

* _ak_ (ahk): preposition. To.
* _bado_ (BAH-doh): preposition. After.
* _da•ia_ (DIE-ah): preposition. Of.
* _depoto_ (day-POH-toh): preposition. Before.
* _do•ia_ (DOY-ah): preposition. From.
* _ënt_ (ehnt): preposition. In. Used to define a place.
* **_jade_** (JAH-day): preposition. Until. ✅
* **_ol_** (ohl): preposition. Than. ✅
* _ont_ (ohnt): preposition. In. Used to define time.
* **_pro_** (proh): preposition. For. ✅
* **_tok_** (tohk): preposition. With. ✅
* _yaz_ (yahz): preposition. Already.

As you can see, they're all over the place. I like the consonants, so what if we made them all end in -l (like ol) or z (like yaz)? It's up to you guys. I'm a fan of L, myself.

---
## QBri offers:

I think there shouldn't be necessarily a certain set ending. I think the only requirement should be that they have to end in a consonant. That way "ank" can stay the same.

As for _daia_ and _doia_, well... languages don't always have to conform to a strict code. So they should remain the same. They can be irregular.

Those are my thoughts.

> AS: While natural languages follow this rule, Hylian is artificial and follows a highly engineered set of paradigms. Perhaps keeping the ball in Kasuto's court, so to speak, is the better option than saying "weird exceptions." With that said -- the ball in Kasuto's court has _no rule at all_ for the ending of prepositions, with the best candidate being _-o_ for prepositions and _-ok_ for adverbs.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries ponders:

I was thinking that, because languages change over time, and often-used words don't really adhere to rules. But now it seems like there are getting to be too many that aren't applying to any rule. There should be at least a FEW that follow it, shouldn't there?

---
## QBri observes:

The way I see it, adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all follow a regular pattern (-a for adjectives, -e for nouns, -ag for verbs, -ok for adverbs) so that leaves conjunctions and prepositions with no standard (which is what Kasuto seems to have done intentionally, considering **the conjunctions and prepositions he's created don't follow any pattern**) so I think we should just go with what we know. And what we do know is that Kasuto left no specific instructions for conjunctions or prepositions. Which is personally fine with me, since there's a lot less conjunctions and prepositions than any of the other categories. So it'll be easy to learn the conjunctions and prepositions, without having to rely on a certain system.

Just my thoughts.

I suppose that'll work, then.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries observes:

> **QBri wrote:**
>
> how much/many - kwanto

I think "how many" may be "_tano_" because in the Common Expressions section, there's the question ,"_Edas ta•iu tano_?" which means, "How old are you?" but the question "_Ta•iras ta•iu jano_?" means, "How are you?" Both of them can't mean "how" so I figured the jano to be "how" and tano to be "how many," since the response you would give to "_edas ta•iu tano_" would be a number.

> **AS reflects:**

I made the suggestion, actually. I know that "fire" is the word for "wind," but, I figured since wind is an element (or at least it is by the time Wind Waker rolls around), it's okay to have an elemental word for wind and a non-elemental word for wind.

> **QBri wrote:**

I trill mine too. I completely agree with you that they sound better that way.

QBri, would it be so painful to add the dots and accents where you need them? If you need a chart of all the keystrokes, I'd be more than happy to oblige.

One more thing, this goes to everyone. I'm away from home right now and STUPIDLY did not mail myself the Hylian Language .docs and .txts, so if you want them, you're going to have to wait until at least Monday (the 11th). Sorry about that.

## QBri offers a compilation:

*SIDE NOTE* - Since all the objective personal pronouns all contain the first letter of the subjective form + ëu, it occurs to me that it's pretty dumb that "you" is "tau." I think we should change it to "tëu," since now that I think about it, it was the only one that was irregular.

So here they are:

Bëu - me 🛑
Tëu - you 🛑
Nëu - us 🛑
Vëu - you all 🛑

Tushen-Anosuke: dude, feel free to suggest new words yourself.

new word or two:

kajhile - guy (teenage male) (kajhiloi - dude *interjection*) ✅
kajhine - girl (teenage female) (kajhinoi - chick) ✅
kajhe - teenager ✅

joshtag - to occur. (used as slang - Kono joshtes? - What's up? What been happening.) synonimous with "pansag" 🛑

That reminds me. I think we should use "batai" and whatever that old word for goodbye was. Like, I think we should keep "ohaio" and "sajanai" but use them as more formal greetings. Batai and the other word for goodbye can be informal words.

Anyways, I think I'm gonna post all the words suggested at this point:

But for the most part, these words (along with the one on Kasuto's site) make up the whole of the hylian language.

## [Tushen](contributors/tushen) appears:

Holy crap, dude. Hylian is missing some very key words. Here's a few I suggest, and you can be sure that more shalt come.

abandonment - adenbe ✅
abandon - adenbag ✅
make (to create) - hedag 🛑 (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
make/force (to make a person...) - impelag ✅
house - albode (mixture of alba and abode) ✅
home - albende 💬 (as _albodi_)
life - alvire 🛑 (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
live - alvirag 🛑 (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
sickness, illness - malborge 🛑 (declined)
evil - malbage 🛑 (declined in deference to prior suggestion _këume_)
want - volag 🛑 (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
see - mirag 🛑 (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
much, more/many - tra, trazwa

EDIT: Also, I don't know if there are any rules for conjunctions, but I suggest using "si" for the word "if". I also suggest using "kok" as the negative forming word. I checked the list you gave me and I haven't seen any ways to make a word negative.

## Tushen panics:

Crap, people, (it looks like) we're getting all the words that we don't need and not the necessary ones. Okay, what are the words for...

## QBri rebuts:

Dude, there's already words for most of what you suggested. You need to go to Kasuto's site and look in the dictionary. Here's the words for the ones you suggested:

| Gloss | Tushen's Word | Official Word |
|:----|:---------:|:---------:|
| to make, to create | hedag | kriashag |
| life | alvire | vïnshe |
| to live | alvirag | vïnshag |
| evil | malbage | këume |
| to want | volag | vo•alag |
| to see | mirag | miarag |
| much, more, many | tra, trazwa | moka, masa, zwa |

make (to create) - hedag ACTUAL WORD: kriashag
life - vïnshe (2 dots over the i)
live - vïnshag (2 dots over i)
evil - këume (2 dots over e)
want - volag ACTUAL WORD - voalag
see - mirag ACTUAL WORD - miarag
much, more/many - tra, trazwa ACTUAL WORDS - much, more - moka many - masa


INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS:

Who - kiu
what - kono
when - kwano
where - dono
why - procho
how - jano
which - doro/kiu

because - protojhek (2 dots over e)
so - lo, taro
of - daia

Dude, then you need to compose a better dictionary for me. 'Cause that last one sucked.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries offers:

Hey, sorry I haven't responded Tushen. I was away since Tuesday of last week and couldn't really access the internet and only got back on Sunday night, then work yesterday and... argh.

I can send you the list of words sometime today (Tuesday April 12) because I've got to modify it and add the new words QBri and others have suggested, and will have it to you (.txt, .doc available shortly) by midnight EDT. Is that all right? In the meantime, Kasuto's list of words is available here as a .txt file. If you would like a .doc version, let me know, but that'll take a little more time to get to you.

EDIT: Additionally, because I didn't see what you said before, Kasuto's got a list of *some* swear and vulgar words. You can find those at the bottom of the Common Expressions page of the Hylian Language Institute.

Also, the word for "if" is "_at_" and the word for forming negatives is "_naz_". The possessive "of" depends on singular or plural possession (and also if what is possessed is explicitly stated), but is similar to the apostrophe-S that we have in English. Here's a quick overview:

Singular object, adjective:
This is my book.
Za ta•iras bagu'sa lërde.

Plural objects, adjective:
These are my books.
Zan ta•iras bagu'san lërdën.

Singular object, pronoun:
This book is mine.
Za lërde ta•iras bagu'su.

Plurarl objects,pronoun:
These books are mine.
Zan lërdën ta•iras bagu'sun.

Hope that helps!

That reminds me. I think we should use "batai" and whatever that old word for goodbye was.


I'm with you on that! "Batá•í" can mean like, "hi" and "jhënta•i" can mean "later" or something.

## Magnas remembers:

*coughs* Oops. Sorry, Venus, I totally forgot about doing the HTML thing. *watches as thought flies out of head... o.O* Got totally side-tracked. *sweat-drop* I hope you aren't exactly expecting it soon? Life has got in the way. It sucks. Just wanted to tell you that, just in case you were wondering.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries smiles:

Don't worry about it, because I sort of forgot about it, too. But take your time with it, Magnas. It's not vastly important. ^_^

EDIT: QBri, I've added most of your words to the dictionary. And it took me a while, whew! Most of them went off without a hitch, but I have a couple of questions about some:

1. There are some words whose parts of speech don't match their English counterparts (everyone, sometime, indeed, etc.). In English, they're all either adverbs or pronouns, but you've turned them into regular nouns (with the exception of jha and vor, I believe). I'm just wondering if that was on purpose, cuz we discussed that before, or if they should be changed.

2. "dega". You mentioned this word once, but never gave it a meaning. Context clues tell me it may mean "illegal", but I'm not sure.

3. "haiag", "aute", "koiag". Not sure if there are supposed to be diphthongs here, so if you'd clarify, I'd appreciate it.

4. I think it was you -- if not, then this goes out to the creator -- who came up with the word "shgote" for work. Kasuto's already made up tïnske (and I suppose tïnskag would follow as the verb), so.

5. via vs. ablat. You've got them both meaning "by way of." Do you have a preferred one? Via is the only one in the dictionary I've got now.

Thanks a lot.

---
## QBri nods:

Okay, sorry, you're right I need to clear up some of these:

1.) A problem in english is that words can often be used as nouns or as adjectives. (i.e. - "all" is a great example. ex. - get all that you can (noun) vs. we all are... (adj. form). Take a quick look:

Toka - all (solely an adjective) Toke - everything/all (noun)
Tokakrone - Forever (noun) vs. Tokakrona - Always (adjective)

The thing is, Hylian words don't quite match up to their english counterparts, so their english translations can be the same for different words. If you tell me the context of the word I used that you think is flawed I'll explain it better. But for now this is all I can tell you.

As for jha and vor, vor can be used as a conjunction. And as for jha, well, sounds (or in this case "interjections") don't always have to follow a strict pattern, since a lot of interjections come from sounds that people cry out under circumstances, so jha could just be irregular.

2.) Give me the context of the word, but I'm pretty sure it's meant to be an adjective form of "dege" which would mean it means "godly" or "divine"

3.) Yes there is supposed to be diphthongs, I just don't know what keys to press to mark it. But they are suppossed to have diphthongs. I don't really think they need to be marked, since "ai" and "au" are already marked in the tutorial as always being one complete sound.

4.) You're right, tinske is the word I should've used. Scrap the "shgote" word.

5.) Keep via. I probably wasn't thinking when I made "ablat" and accidently added it. But you're right keep via.

Okay, if there's nothing else I'll post later.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries offers:

1. Okay, I'll add on the words just as you have them, regardless of their part of speech in English.

2. "Jhe... Ru tairas objhekte dega. Sek naz toka-hiten panktas tenshag ru." was the quote.

3. Diphthongs and accents:
á - alt+0225
à - alt+0224
ä - alt+0228
é - alt+0233
è - alt+0232
ë - alt+0235
í - alt+0237
ì - alt+0236
ï - alt+0239
ó - alt+0243
ò - alt+0242
ú - alt+0250
ù - alt+0249
ü - alt+0252
• - alt+0149
· - alt+0183

4. and 5. Gotcha. No problem.

---
## QBri explains:

As for the word "dega," yes, in that context it's being used to make it a sarcastic phrase, and it is an adjective form of dege. So it means, "godly, divine," etc.

Sorry for any misconceptions!

-Q

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries inquires:

QBri, questions:

--Would the meaning of "chirkau" be closer to "next to/adjacent" or "nearby"?
--Would the meaning of "natha" be closer to "near/close" or "tight"?

Curious because I'm writing up a song that's got "close" and "tight" in it and I don't know which words I should use. Since you made them up, I think you'd know best.

And then we could use the words I made up as something else completely. XD

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries updates:

I said I had a .doc and a .txt available for copies of both sets of words. I've updated it so that I have .html and .txt files of both. Sorry, Magnas. (You can still practice!)

Kasuto's list of words that I uploaded to the site is a bit outdated; there were lots of mistakes, and words I shouldn't have included. So, if you want copies of anything (not like anyone's actually reading this post, lol. I'm just damned dedicated), PM me for them. Don't rely on what I've uploaded, okay?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries muses:

Pata Hikari brought up the idea for different words for different swords. I thought up one yesterday:

garne - dagger

\^\_\^

Oooh. And I have a suggestion with regards to the language itself. How about making the diphthongs one letter? Like, the way the font is set up now, a letter like a•i takes up as much space as writing ai. To see what I mean, take a look at what I sketched up (size 14 font):

[image missing]

/This does sound like a fair call, especially since Kasuto's dictionary treats the diphthongs as unique letters. If the Hylian alphabet treats them as a letter, condensing them to a single glyph sounds like a good idea./

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries adds:

Well, here's an interesting discovery....

Thanks to Darth Citrus, I looked through the OLD kasuto.net files and found a couple more Hylian words. I also have to retract one of my suggestions.... Here are the new words that have been added to my master lists:

**neta** - new
**rektag** - to update

And the word that's been retracted (and probably recycled into a new word):

**\*jiwa** - new

## BBB observes:

Interesting.

WHEW. These have all been added, by the way, to the dictionary. Oh, Arrow.... I had to change "albe" from "Sacred Realm" to "Holiness" because the meaning fit better. Remember, the Dark World was, at one time, the Sacred Realm, so it made little sense to have two different things for it, especially, when in OoT-era, the Dark World didn't exist yet. The Dark World only came about in LttP-era, which, of course, is well after OoT.

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And _**votoere**_ could still work before that too since the Sacred Realm was a land set apart from Hyrule, full of golden light and power, unlike the normal Hyrule. Not quite an opposite, but close enough to work. Anyways, I changed both of those on my page to match. Thanks again for all your help last night.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries gushes:

Thank YOU for all of yours! No way I would have come up with all those words by myself.... and the way you came up with hour, minute and second was brilliant!!

## [Oluademi Wolfwood](contributors/oluademi_wolfwood) emerges from the woodwork:

You do realize that this is ALL YOUR FAULT. ::kicks, then finds a comfy chair in the front of the classroom.::

First of all, 451? Holy shit, V. I knew you guys had it fairly developed but GODDESSES not that well! Of course, my first mission is to learn all of OniGanon's Gerudo rules. Then I'll worry about the Hylian rules. But eh.

While I was scrounging through looking up words for Mikari's broken Hylian, I realized there weren't many words for food. Food is important you know. Not so much specific foods like cheese and fish and roasted cucco. But breakfast and lunch and dinner. 'pologies if you have any of these down already, eh? If anything, you can recycle the words. Oh, and do the whole grammar correct bit too, cuz hell if I know what I'm saying.

So at first I was going to base the words off of breakfast lunch dinner themselves, in some other language maybe. But then I realized, what are they? Meals. When? Prospectively, morning, afternoon, evening. So the quickest and easiest thing to do?

malsete = meal. mahl-seh-teh. literally 'group of food'.
minazisete = breakfast.
tiudrisete = lunch.
na•istrisete = dinner.

Gee, I'm gonna feel real stupid if someone already came up with this.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries remembers:

Actually, Olua... if you remember correctly, there IS a word for fish. You helped make it up. :o

The word you've got for "meal" works, but not its literal translation. The word for food is koeme (and the verb koemag), so no dice there, but if we forgo your translation, it's okay. Also, the pronunciation/spelling must be changed. We can keep the pronunciation of the second syllable as "seh", if we change the spelling to malsëte, but the last syllable HAS to be "tay" not "teh". Otherwise... well, it just doesn't make sense in Hylian.

The word for "morning" (by itself), by the way, is minazE, not minazI. I'd change that, but I think shortening your words is in order. How about we just take until the first vowels, that is, misëte, tisëte and na•isëte?

Also, I've got a few new ones on my own.
hotimag (hoh-TEE-mahg): verb. To smell.
hotime (hoh-TEE-may): noun. Smell; scent.
ai (AH-ee): interjection. Oh! Ah! etc.

---
## Pata Hikari shares some new ideas:

I just thought of something... there are words for the sounds animals make in most lanuages ( I think) So shouldn't Hylian have some?

Bra- For the sound of a dogs bark.

Loc- A Cucco would make this noise.

Any more ideas?

---
## Pata Hikari continues:

Ok, basicly I've worked out a hylian system of measurement, because I doubt they would use ours. =D

First is a matra this is equal to 3 inches. Nine matra make a dënleto. Four dënleto make a chuka. twenty-one chuka make a leto. eleven leto make a teri. And three teri make a maleto

1 maleto = 1.18125 miles (Yes, I did the math.)

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries cheers:

Random numbers are COOL. Yay for the American and Hylian systems of measuring distance!

So I'm guessing that this leto would be the standard unit of measure -- like our mile -- because you've got "big" and "small" versions of it. Also, a chuka is exactly 9 feet. Neat!

Oh, and stick Es on the ends of all the words because they're nouns. :::nod:::

---
## Arrow sighs:

You guys do realize I'm totally going to have to use that distance system for my future fic now, right?  :)

## Venus, Queen of Faeries is struck by inspiration:

> **OniGanon wrote:**

> Directions (up, down, left, right, forward, back, compass points)

More inspiration yesterday. I was thinking that since there are eight elements in the Zelda worlds (Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, Earth and Wind/Air), that each should represent a compass point. Something like when the InuYasha crew was looking for Naraku and they were told something about the direction of the ox and tiger (which is northwest, apparently), if you've seen that particular storyarc.

Anyway. So the elements should each represent one of the eight compass points. But which would go where? I figure the opposites should be opposite each other: Light and Shadow, Fire and Water, Earth and Air. That leaves Forest and Spirit, which aren't opposites per se, but if you figure that a forest is full of life, and a spirit sort of represents the afterlife, then it kind of works.

So now we've got opposites, but where to put them all? I thought that perhaps Light should go in the east, as that's where the sun rises. Shadow would then be west, and that makes sense because by the time the sun's in the west, it's getting dark out. Earth should be on the bottom (south), closest to the earth, and that would make Wind/Air up top (north), which is closest to the sky.

Next, I thought Fire should go in the southwest, between Earth and Shadow, because fires are ground-based and cause death. Water, then, would be in the northeast, between Air and Light because rain comes from the sky and gives life (light). That leaves Forest in the southeast, between Earth and Light, because a forest is an earthy thing, and... life (light), so yeah. Spirit, death and cuz they ascend to heaven or whatever. Either way, this should sum it all up:

Just... don't ask me for names of all the compass directions. ^_^;

---
## Pata Hikari suggests:

One could always use the "Elemental" words for the compass directions. =D

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries inquires:

Of course, but how would we change them so that they're different from the elements themselves? I didn't quite get to that part of the thought. XD

---
## Pata Hikari answers:

Why can't they just be words that you reconize in contrex?

Homonyms are part of every language, and these wouldn't even be true homonyms.

> AS: I agree with this. If you say you went to the element of Spirit it could be simply recognized that you mean you went to the northwest -- there's no need to make a special marking to distinguish the elements from the compass directions, because context exists.

## [Auric Trinity](contributors/auric_trinity) offers:

Hey I thought of a word. I don't know if this has been done before (yes I suffer from n00b-itis :roll: ) but here goes:
banshi (ag)
Spelled: bete-akte-note-shïte-ite

Verb
Def: To scream or shriek (from fear or terror)

Root: Banshee

Anyway hope that helps. Hylian rocks! I should learn it as fluently as I know Al Bhed!

Dreh eh Auric Trinity, cekhehk uvv.
Oui cdyo lmycco, Vinculum.

## Auric Trinity lewdly proposes:

Sorry about multi posting like this but I just thought of another new word and my memory is so bad that I risk forgetting my new word by typing this explanation. Whatev' here goes:

Zebrakum (ag)

zante-ete-bete-rote-akte-kate-ute-mate

Verb
Def: To eclipse or block light

root: derived from a Lewis Black tirade on the subject of sunblock
"[Sunblock] could be zebra cum, you don't know!"

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries accepts:

Welcome, Auric Trinity, and thanks for your suggestions. Feel free to add more. \^\_\^ Yours and bluelink greg's have been added to the list I've been keeping. If you'd like to see it, just PM/IM/e-mail me. My contact info is available on every post. \^\_\^

## Auric Trinity suggests:

> **Venus, Queen of Faeries wrote:**
>
> Of course, but how would we change them so that they're different from the elements themselves?

First a new word

Gate=Pite
SP: pate-ite-tote-ete
Derived from St. Peter at the Golden Gates

Just a suggestion but why not take the elements and attatch "-pite" for a compass direction. Also to say "northern" or "southern" etc. attach
"-pita" (making it an adjective)

so all in all we have:
Solanpite East

Perlunpite Southwest

Anpite Northeast

Molornpite Southeast

Hevonpite Northwest

Galenpite South

Silfanpite North

And:
Solanpita Eastern

Perlunpita Southwestern

Anpita Northwestern

Molornpita Southeastern

Hevonpita Northwestern

Galenpita Southern (y'all)

Silfanpita Northern

You stay classy Vinculum.
I'm Ron Burgundy?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries's jaw drops:

:O Excellent idea, Auric! I'm gonna add all those words to el listo grande.

("Listo" actually means "ready" in Spanish, but I don't care. XD)

Oh, afterthought: should we add accents to preserve the original pronunciation of the words? It's your call, man; you had a brilliant idea, so this is all yours. Until you decide, I'll keep the words in a separate list from the big one.

---
## Auric Trinity bows:

I just don't know how to show accents. accent as you see fit. You're the leader of this movement, mostly. I consider myself a vassal of the Queen

Is there a Hylian word for "face?" Because "mask" could just be face put on the same formula with "-oke."

One more thing:

merkle
SP: mate-ente-rote-lete-kate-ente
monument/gravestone
derived from Merkle (rhymes with Steve Erkul (sp?)) Monuments, a small business near where I live.

Accent as you see fit, my liege.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries explains:

Accents are really easy.... I'm sure that I posted the list of how to do them somewhere in this thread. With respect to the accents, though, they're a reflection of how YOU would pronounce the words. So, I ask you: heVONpita or hevonPIta? (and so on.)

There's a word for face... either aikwe and andwe. Something like that. One means face and the other means finger. I've gotten my own words confused. I'll add 'mask' to the list, and also merkle.

We're comin' up on the big five-oh-oh, everyone! Thanks to all who have participated for your help! Together we can make this project take off again, and I hope to hear more from all of you -- and new people too -- in the next five hundred. ^_^!!!

The latter two are the dots you can use to denote a diphthong. It doesn't matter which you use; it's a matter of style. I prefer the former, only because it's easier to see. ^_^

---
## Auric Trinity shrugs:

I'd accent whichever syllable comes before the "-pite." In this context I consider -pite a suffix, i.e. not receiving an accent. Plus Hevonpite rolls off the tounge better than Hevonpite.

So with Compass directions, syllable before -pite is accented.

New word for "Axe": Garsite
Pronounced: gar-SEE-tay
Sp: Gante-akte-rote-sate-ite-tote-ete
Root: Garcia of Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones

EDIT: Thanks for that list Venus.

EDIT (AGAIN?!): Dari! You're right! My bad! :oops:

Esterag- To insult
ënte-sate-tote-ënte-rote-akte-gante

## Auric Trinity catches his breath:

Well sorry about this double post, but no one's been here for a couple of days so I'm making sure that it isn't forgotten.

But do not fear! I come with new words.

Word #501
Mahoe - mage
mate-akte-hënte-ote-ete
Derived from the Japanese word for magic "Mahou"
Furthermore this can be combined with an element to designate a specific type of mage:
Ex: Galanmahoe=Earth mage
Hevonmahoe=Spirit mage

Word #502
Tsukae - operator/user/wielder
Tote-sate-ute-kate-akte-tote-ete
Derived from Japanese verb "Tsukau," to use
This can also be compounded with a weapon (-its "ete" ending.) to denote a warrior that uses that weapon:
Ex: Katentsukae= Swordsman
Garsitsukae= Axewielder, etc.

And finally...
Word #503
Mevine- master of a skill
Mate-ete-vete-ite-note-ete
Derived from "mevyn" (sp?)
This is also capable of being compounded with either of the two above words to denote mastery of a certain art or stand alone as a generic term for a master in the same sense. (i.e. this does NOT mean master in the sense of a commander.)
Ex: Hevonmahomevine= Master spirit mage
Katentsukamevine= Master swordsman (Swordmaster)

Hope to see lots of new faces (or avatars as the case may be :roll: ) here.
Only 497 until the thousandth word.

## [XenonnMaximus](contributors/xenonnmaximus) writes:

How about Malangeld. It's a combination of Maligned(looks fine but doesn't work) and Mangeld /mangled/ (looks broken but may still work). It means looks terrible and it doesn't work.

Don't be too hard on me it's my first time posting on something like this.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries jokes:

D: THAT IS A TERRIBLE SUGGESTION AND YOU SHOULD NEVER POST HERE AGAIN EW GO AWAY.

LOL I'm just kidding, of course. I'll add it, and yours too, Auric. ^_^ (It's spelled "mangled", by the way.) Xennon, you've got a PM from me.

Auric: I've just remembered, I've got a word on the list that means TO shield, to cover, to guard, etc. Here's what I suggest: your word should be the equipment shield, mine will be general protection (the same way you can use a garbage can lid in a snowball fight). How's that sound? I also have a suggestion: vomevine, for a novice or beginner. ^_^

Also, Auric, I've noticed that you've got a "ts" combo going on in there. "Ts" was actually planned to be its own letter (see the old thread, here. Actually, I'm glad to have linked to that; now it won't take me ages to find it again). I think, the same way that we use "ch" as one letter, that we'll have to do the same for "ts". Let me know what you think, before I add that one, and also check out the other planned letters, too. Note: the thread was created over three years ago, but the letters were never added -- officially -- to the language or the font.

---
## Auric Trinity raises an eyebrow:

To quote Jack Sparrow, *grabbed at throat by skeletal hand* "Well that's interesting." I was unaware of a ch, ts, etc.

In that light, "ts" will be the way to go not "tote sate" for tsukae

As far as your suggestion on "Skolire" goes, OKBYME.

As for my usual suggestion in a post.

#507
Dorobe - Thief
Date-ote-rote-ote-bete-ete
Derived from the Japanese "Dorobo" meaning thief

Logically, this would make "Dorobag" to steal and making it #508

> **Jerin strikes:**
>
> There's already a word for thief, **_diebe,_** from Kasuto. Your word will fit well in a different place, though.

Oh and "vomevine" sounds great, it even sounds n00bish.

---
## Venus, Queen of Fairies points out:

Gee, thanks. :/ LOL How's it sound great and n00bish at the same time?

Vo- is the prefix meaning un-, im-, in-, etc.; basically, it negates whatever follows. I figured an "un-master" would be a novice.

There's actually a word for thief, already, one of Kasuto's creations, "diebe". Your words are similar, though. Interesting. :o

---
## Auric Trinity nods:

When I said n00bish I meant in pronounciation. Phoenetically it sounds sort of shaky and unsure, like a novice. You are, as usual, a Hilanmevinne the Chaos Overlord meant no offense.

Animade - pain
Akte-note-ite-mate-akte-date-ete
Derived from Anima the Dark Aeon of FF X. (special attack: pain)

Ma & Dën modify levels of pain: i.e. Manimade=Agony and Dënanimade=mild discomfort

---
## Venus, Queen of Fairies observes:

Oh, none was taken. I meant the "gee thanks" jokingly. I guess it didn't come across too well, even with the LOL right there. Sorry!

D: We've got a word for pain, too. It's ite, homophonous with the letter. (Anima's Pain attack was kinda scary. I got this unnerving chill whenever he did it.)

---
## Auric concedes:

Well then. What about using Animade for "oblivion" (DAMN! I loved using that move!  :twisted: )
Oh and on the subject of oblivion. I am completely oblivious to subtlies. The "LOL" though effective on a normal mortal was lost on these ears. eheheh

But also:
Lustre - Chaos
Lete-ute-sate-tote-rote-ete
From Luster as in "Black Luster Soldier-Envoy of the Beginning" or its Japanese name "Chaos Soldier-Messenger of Destruction"
(Avid Yugioh collecter/theorist/player. Damn proud of it! I revel in my rentsiness! 8) )

>

FINALLY! I came up with another new word. I'm considering doing words with Vinny members' names a roots. I have only one so far.

# 513
Onigara
Ote-note-ite-gante-akte-rote-akte
Adj. Drunk/Intoxicated
Derived from "Oni Garo." Got the idea from his avatar.

Venus, I'll let you think up a meaning for "Vekwof e/ag/a/etc." since you know yourself better than I do.  :-)

Thought of another Vinny member word.
#514
Utmastag
Ute-tote-mate-akte-sate-tote-ete
To revive
Derived from OoT Master who, in her early days, pulled a lot of necromancy. (PS OoT Master, this is not a flame. I'm making a humorous allusion to the past/tribute to you. Interpret this as you like, just not as a flame.  :lol: )

## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

Interesting T-M combination there, Auric.

I found a word from long, long ago that I credit to Kasuto:

kanshise (kahn-SHEE-say): noun. Guardian.

I choose "lively" as the meaning for vekwofa. No matter what mood I'm really in, I can always act happy and spirited and cheerful on the outside. Pansale dëme pante! W00T!

It's unsurprising that I've kept a list of all the words we've got so far, so if anyone's worried (all, like, one of me), nothing here, at least, was lost, except for the posts.

So, yes. I'm back, but only for a moment, to post a new word that someone actually e-mailed to me.

Awesome!

The word is merke, derived from "mercury" to mean "metal". Okay? Okay. Dictionary's been updated.

## [Dagger341](contributors/dagger341) writes:

Yay! my first post! I can now share my creativity with the world! Ok here's my first posted word. How about plute meaning "one who works with metal" or "smith" then plutag could be "to work with metal" or "to smith" both are the same statement, but I want to be as clear as possible. How's that for a first-timer? Let me know what you guys think. Oh yeah, and keep the language alive! :D

So, I also think it's strange that I've had two requests for the dictionary in the past two days. :O!

Oh, and happy Halloween. ^_^

## [Stella](contributors/stella_snile) writes:

Hi i'm back, my old user snile seems to be deleted so I made a new one.
Well on with the words.

It have botherd me for some while that there only was on gemstone in the langue; siafire . so it took a look on the word, the first part sia which means blue caugth my attention, what if the other gemstones also started whith their color?
then it would be:

Miafire ruby
Sihiafire emerald
Simiafire amethyst
Hiafire topaz

For diamond there would be used a word which means white or clear. I'll go whith white. For white I have made the word Via drived from the Norewgian word for white hvit.
Then we have:

Viafire diamond

## Venus, Queen of Fairies smiles:

Yya, new faces!!! Sorry about the hiatus, you guys. I'm usually quick to respond to new posts, but I was avoiding all game-related forums until my completion of Twilight Princess.

Oh my Goddesses.

Anyway, I thank you for your contributions. I need to get to bed soon, but your words seem good, and I'll look them over more carefully when I get home from work. Thank you so much!

I'm glad the gemstones caught your attention, Stella. Did you know that I derived the word for blue FROM the word for sapphire? XD I'm glad you followed.

And Dagger, I've got your words, too. (The other planets should get words if the dwarf gets one. Tee hee.)

Total count: 571.

---
## Stella offers:

Great minds think alike^^

I got a new word this time I have entered the bug world.

Myre Ant

Myre is made from the swedish word for ant: myra (I use to call my sister myra^^ so I have to thank her for this word)

wow, i'm getting into this, i'm working on new words all the time.

## Sage of Silence asks:

I'll admit, I'm lazy and don't want to look in 13 pages of posts, but I was wondering, is there a Hylian word for "until" yet? Right now, I'm using "az", for "to the", but until would suit the phrase much better. It's for a fanfic I'm working on (and is in the post your own fanfic section, if you'd like to get a better idea on how until/to the is being used). I don't know enough about how the language is constructed to suggest a word myself. If there is one, could someone let me know?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries answers:

Until = jade

---

## Dagger341 offers:

well I guess I can make words that please all the planet-lovers. (no offense to anyone)
Venag - to marry
Martag - to fight
Satutag - to time

that's all for now. will get more soon.

---

## Venus, Queen of Fairies smiles:

I like my verb. ^_^!! (With the last one, what exactly do you mean? Like, measuring time?)

Stella, if you've got a modified pronunciation for me, it would really help. But no rush. ^_^

---
## Rayven offers:

Venus, if Im translating what Stella said correctly, it should me something like me-reh. or something.

I DO read this section, though I dont post here. Ill learn the langueage some day, maybe.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries nods:

That's what I think, too, Rayven, but I just want to doublecheck before I etch it in stone (i.e., scribble it in Notepad). I don't wanna commit it to memory if it's wrong, you know? It's a bitch to learn to pronounce things another way than the way you learned it.

And thanks for reading. I do appreciate it. ^_^

By the way, Dagger341, I'm so sorry. D: Two of those words have already been thought up, BUT, we'll hold onto venag (exisiting word: ipag) and martag (existing word: reaketag) for something else. If you do mean the third for measuring time, we'll keep it, but I wanna make sure, so I haven't added it to the list yet.

And that list is in sore need of a re-count. I probably skipped something, somewhere.

---
## Dagger341 apologizes:

well how about Martag mean "to war"? I do not believe that is taken. Venag could be "to inspire". Yes I did intend Satutag to be in reference to mesuring time. I also have other words to add.

Jhutag - to storm

and in a different form Jhute - storm
also if you take the noun forms of the other words they should be

Marte - war
Venag - inspiration
and Satute - total time

Unless there is something I missed these are all new. I could br wrong of course. Venus apparently there are words that I missed. Would you send me an updated version of the word list and pronunciations? Thanks.

on a different note has anyone developed a dictionary sorted by part of speech? Is it even a good idea?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

We've actually got ilidane for "storm (noun)," but we could use jhutag for the verb, if that's cool.

The other words seem good, so I'll add those, and yes, I'll send you an updated version of the list. I'm really sorry if the one I sent was inaccurate.

And if you'll e-mail me about it, ANYONE who wants an updated list will receive one when we reach six hundred original words. After that, it's up to you guys to keep track, but I'll do it this one time. ^_^ Incentive to keep up the good work. Really, I'm suprised, impressed, elated and humbled at the amount of suggestions we've received lately. Everyone's doing a lovely job, and I feel bad that I haven't come up with very many myself. XD

Um, once I get bored enough, I'll do the parts-of-speech list. ^_^;; I'm working every day through Sunday at least, so I'm kinda busy now, but maybe I'll get on it on my next day off.

EDIT: Seven new words added, and Dagger341, did you mean "inspiration" to be venage? Only you left off the E and vene is a naughty word. :3 I added it to the dictionary already, but if it wasn't meant to be venage, just let me know. Thanks!

---
## Dagger341 blushes:

Thank you for fixing that for me. I cant find that word in the dictionary so I have no idea what I said. Ok, now I feel silly. I thought for sure that I had not seen "storm" anywhere. oh well. New word.

folbiukoge - earthquake (taken from folkag and biukoge. Literally "rolling earth").

Yes. Its cool. Use it. If something I do helps, then by all means use it.
On the subject of the parts of speech dictionary I do have one started. I have the pronouns and most of the verbs done. I hope this helps. Please send the revised version when you get the chance. Thank you for your time.

## Venus, Queen of Faeries snaps her fingers:

Ah, there's word I've forgotten to suggest:
