Kasuto himself has already made a word for truth. It's _veuarde_ (probably from the same root), and _veuarda_ for "true".

(I don't sound rude, do I? I don't mean to. If I do, I'm sorry.)

Oh, I wasn't suggesting that we make them adverbs, I just use MW to doublecheck things when I'm unsure of what they are. We can keep them adjectives; it makes more sense to me that way.

Haha, that was me (I've since figured it out. I was just really slow on the uptake). But now everyone can know. Yay!!

Just one suggestion. How about _bëu_ instead of _mëu_? Cuz all the objective forms start with the same letter as the unobjective ones, so.... In the meantime, I'll add all of the suggestions to the list, and if I have to change it, I'll do it later. We're coming up on 150 really quickly. ^_^
