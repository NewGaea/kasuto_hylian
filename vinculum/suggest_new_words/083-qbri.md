I think there shouldn't be necessarily a certain set ending. I think the only requirement should be that they have to end in a consonant. That way "ank" can stay the same.

As for _daia_ and _doia_, well... languages don't always have to conform to a strict code. So they should remain the same. They can be irregular.

Those are my thoughts.
