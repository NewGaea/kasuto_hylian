## [Auric Trinity](contributors/auric_trinity) offers:

Hey I thought of a word. I don't know if this has been done before (yes I suffer from n00b-itis :roll: ) but here goes:
banshi (ag)
Spelled: bete-akte-note-sh√Øte-ite

Verb
Def: To scream or shriek (from fear or terror)

Root: Banshee

Anyway hope that helps. Hylian rocks! I should learn it as fluently as I know Al Bhed!
