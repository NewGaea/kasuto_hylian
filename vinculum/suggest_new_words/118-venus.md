## Venus, Queen of Faeries is struck by inspiration:

More inspiration yesterday. I was thinking that since there are eight elements in the Zelda worlds (Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, Earth and Wind/Air), that each should represent a compass point. Something like when the InuYasha crew was looking for Naraku and they were told something about the direction of the ox and tiger (which is northwest, apparently), if you've seen that particular storyarc.

Anyway. So the elements should each represent one of the eight compass points. But which would go where? I figure the opposites should be opposite each other: Light and Shadow, Fire and Water, Earth and Air. That leaves Forest and Spirit, which aren't opposites per se, but if you figure that a forest is full of life, and a spirit sort of represents the afterlife, then it kind of works.

So now we've got opposites, but where to put them all? I thought that perhaps Light should go in the east, as that's where the sun rises. Shadow would then be west, and that makes sense because by the time the sun's in the west, it's getting dark out. Earth should be on the bottom (south), closest to the earth, and that would make Wind/Air up top (north), which is closest to the sky.

Next, I thought Fire should go in the southwest, between Earth and Shadow, because fires are ground-based and cause death. Water, then, would be in the northeast, between Air and Light because rain comes from the sky and gives life (light). That leaves Forest in the southeast, between Earth and Light, because a forest is an earthy thing, and... life (light), so yeah. Spirit, death and cuz they ascend to heaven or whatever. Either way, this should sum it all up:

Just... don't ask me for names of all the compass directions. ^_^;
