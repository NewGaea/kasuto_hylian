* who - _kiu_ (kasuto already made this, this is just a reminder)

* where - _dono_

* grass - **mike**
* tree - **ëde** (first e needs 2 dots)

*side note* [[venus|someone on this forum]] [[065-venus|posted a suggestion for the word 'wind' as being "_fethe,_"]] just to let whoever that was know: there's already a word for 'wind' in the dictionary. It's "_fire_." *end side note*

Side Question: How do you all pronounce the Hylian letter "R"? In Kasuto's alphabet section it says it's pronounced like an English "r," but I've always trilled/rolled the Hylian R's because I always think a trilled R sounds better than an english R. But I just wanted to know how you guys pronounced them? (If you all are actually weird enough to talk to yourselves in Hylian.)

* Well... (interjection) - **Jhe...**
* Thing, object - **Objhëkte** (first e needs two dots over it)
* Yeah, sure, of course - **Jha** (interjection) (as _jhai_)

That's all I got for now. Later.

[Marijuana? What is that?]
"Jhe... Ru tairas objhekte dega. Sek naz toka-hiten panktas tenshag ru." > "Jhe... ru tairas ab objhëkte dega, sek tokan hiten maz panktas tenshag ru."
[Well... it is a divine object. But everybody can't have it ]
