## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] proposes:

\*\_\* Marry me! I see you even included Wind and Earth. How clever of you! (_Perin_ could also double as the normal word for spirit!)

I was looking through the [[wayback|ooooooold Kas.net]] (thanks, Lysia!) and found the old Hylian Language. Well, not much has changed in three and a half years, but a few words did, most notably hello and good-bye. Hello used to be **_batá•í_** (bah-TIE), and now it's _oha•io_ (oh-HIGH-oh). Goodbye used to be **_jhënta•i_** (JHEHN-tie) and now it's _sajaná•í_ (Sah-jah-NIGH). (The words for fire and righteousness only changed by pronunciation and apostrophe, respectively.)

I like _batá•í_ and _jhënta•i_. We should use them for something, don't you think? (I actually like _batá•í_ for hello a lot better than _oha•io_.)

Normal words (non-elementals):

* forest - **mavlise** (mahv-LEE-say)
* light - **rokèlzise** (roh-KEHL-zee-say)
* to light (a candle or something): **rokèlzisag** - [[emekthian]], look! I managed to incorporate a bit of one of your words!
* earth - **bí•úkoge** (BYOO-koh-gay). Something I just made up with letters I felt weren't used enough.
* wind - **fethe** (FAY-thay; rom Old Irish "feth", meaning "air")

Oh, and I found a mistake in the .doc, Pata. I SWITCHED _ënt_ and _ont._ Sorry about that!
