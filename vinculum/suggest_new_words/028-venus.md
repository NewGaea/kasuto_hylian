I should major in Necromancy in college instead of Mathematics. ^_^;;

Today: body parts! We've already got eyes and arms ("_Vosu'san opjhën sha•i va•isas ab nosu ëk Vosu'san brinstën da•ia amkane sha•i witas ab nosu_" no, that wasn't from memory and no, I'm not a dork), and I suggested a few more (foot, head and others), but there are still some we don't have. Until now.

Ear - _hizaze_
Nose - _isue_
Mouth - _muntha•ize_
Hair - _serise_
Heart - _chepaye_
Face - _andwe_
Finger - _aikwe_
Toe - _adakae_ (from _aikwe da•ia kame_; fingers of the foot -- real original, I know -- _kame_ having been previously suggested for foot.)

A note about _serise_: The singular is used to mean one strand of hair; the hair on your head would be _serisën_. Like the French _cheveux_. That means 'hair', but it's plural, because you've got more than one hair on your head. You would say "_Mes cheveux sont..._" "My hairs are..." unlike the English "My hair is..."

Here are some nouns that you can play with if you feel like it:
_batyahe, pete._

And a new nounverb: **kiss**: _magze, magzag._

I'm done now. You may continue skipping over the post/thread/forum.
