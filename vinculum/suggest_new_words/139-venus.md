Interesting T-M combination there, Auric.

I found a word from long, long ago that I credit to Kasuto:

kanshise (kahn-SHEE-say): noun. Guardian.

I choose "lively" as the meaning for vekwofa. No matter what mood I'm really in, I can always act happy and spirited and cheerful on the outside. Pansale dÃ«me pante! W00T!

It's unsurprising that I've kept a list of all the words we've got so far, so if anyone's worried (all, like, one of me), nothing here, at least, was lost, except for the posts.

So, yes. I'm back, but only for a moment, to post a new word that someone actually e-mailed to me.

Awesome!

The word is merke, derived from "mercury" to mean "metal". Okay? Okay. Dictionary's been updated.
