QBri, questions:

--Would the meaning of "chirkau" be closer to "next to/adjacent" or "nearby"?
--Would the meaning of "natha" be closer to "near/close" or "tight"?

Curious because I'm writing up a song that's got "close" and "tight" in it and I don't know which words I should use. Since you made them up, I think you'd know best.

And then we could use the words I made up as something else completely. XD
