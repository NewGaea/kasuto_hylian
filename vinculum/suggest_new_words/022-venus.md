## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Fairies]] indulges:

Yes, it's very in-depth. Just like any other language. And it's nowhere NEAR completion; the stuff you see in this topic isn't even "official," I just like to help out and suggest words. Whether my suggestions are taken or not is something different, but it's good to help, you know?

I saw the HLI updated for the first time in almost THREE MONTHS, so I had to take a look. I was slightly disappointed to see that it was only a comment, but I got over myself and started looking over my work. I got a teeeeeeeny bit of inspiration and two (four?) new vocabulary words.

There's this problem that's been plaguing me for a year. Underwear. :::laughs::: If you've read the topic, then you know what I'm talking about. If not, well, bear with me.

[[k-chan|KChan]] made up the word for undies, _usheoke._ Fantastic. I took it and ran.

Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "_nusheoke_" for "girls' underclothes" and "_lusheoke_" for "boys' underclothes." "_Usheoke_" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "_dënnusheoke_" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::

I ran into a couple of problems, though:

> Of course, there are two SMALL problems with what I've done.... One: the double n in "_dënnusheoke._" Every letter in Hylian is supposed to be pronounced. How do you pronounce two Ns in a row? Two: the N and L prefixes only work for nouns that start with a vowel. What about the ones that start in consonants? I was thinking an apostrophe might work, but then again, it might not. "_N'kamoke_" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

I came up with a solution I didn't like:

> Now that I've slept on it, it probably makes more sense to make them _usheokile_ and _usheokine_ as opposed to the way I had it. Thanks, [[oniganon|OniGanon]]. It cures the double N problem, in _dënusheokine_. I *was* trying to go for something different, though.... I didn't quite want it to be like _dégile/dégine_ or _piántile/piántine,_ because underwear aren't people, lol.

And left it at that. [[006-venus|I later changed "dën" to "dëna" since "small" is an adjective.]] "_Dën_'" would be used as the prefix if the next word started with a vowel, and "_dëna_" if it started with a consonant, or if there were another prefix. I was thinking that since I mentioned _N_ and _L,_ I could use that for gender itself. Simply, "_ne_" and "_na_" for "female" and "_le_" and "_la_" for male ("female" and "male" can be either a noun or an adjective, depending on usage; mostly adjectives). With that done, the underwear problem is solved. "_Dënusheokine_" ceases to exist because the "_in_" at the end implies the noun is a sentient being, and underwear most certainly is not.

Similarly to "_dën'-_" and "_dëna-_", "_na_" and "_la_" would be apostrophized (is that a word? I can't find a dictionary that has a verb "to apostrophe") if the word it was describing started with a vowel. When used in conjunction, "small" would be "_dëna-_", because both "_na_" and "_la_" start with consonants, so good thing for that; there won't be apostrophes all over the place. "Lingerie," then, becomes "_Dënan'usheoke._" Man-thongs (ew?), "_dënal'usheoke._" "_Ma_" would not have this rule. That's what we call irregular, folks.

WHEW. I hope you got all that.

One more thing. I thought:

I think "_Ushe_" works better as the word for "crotch". Woohoo, more irregularities! It doesn't need to be broken down into gender, because I think that would be understood, given the person in question. And we've got words for male and female now, besides.

There need to be more words with the complex letter sounds, like _a•ite_ and such. And irregularities! Irregularities (even though Hylian is mostly regular) still need to exist, and they're fun because you can confuse people with them!!

Okay, I'm done for now. Sorry, everyone. ^_^;;
