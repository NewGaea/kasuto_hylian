Simply put, this iteration of language doesn't really need these words, and it is explicitly stated in [[06-asonën|Asonën]] that the pronouns _do not change forms based on role._ To add these to this iteration of Hylian is, in my view, directly contrary to the intentions of Kasuto.

As [[venus|Venus]] elaborates in [[074-venus|the following post]]:

> I'm not saying you're right, and I'm not saying you're wrong, but maybe using the direct object particle before the pronoun like this is just one of those things about Hylian that's weird to foreigners. Personally, I accept a lot of that. Makes it more challenging and more fun, like it's really a real language. ^_^

In my words: The use of _ab_ to separate the Subject and Verb from the Objects of the sentence, is just one of the rules of the language, something you need to learn and do for Hylian. It is similar to using particles like は, が, を, etc. in Japanese or learning all of the principal forms of verbs in Latin, or vowel harmony in Turkish or Finnish.

The above statement from Venus, and my wording of it, reflects my thoughts -- if anything, I would rather see these cases evolve in future forms of the language than be shoe-horned into Kasuto's "Modern" or "Era of Time" version.
