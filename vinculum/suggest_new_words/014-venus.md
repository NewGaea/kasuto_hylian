One more suggestion: Blowing people off.

Most interjections seem to end in i, and blowing someone off (don't ask why I thought of it, this stuff just pops up in my head), seems like something one might need. Something to say a sarcastic "yeah, right," scoff, or just plain old "pssssh."

I suggest "**jhi**." Monosyllabic, two letters, and it's not difficult to pronounce. AND, it uses the not-too-often used JH letter. ^_^

And tongue twisters! Don't know why I was thinking about that either, but along with the words [[k-chan|K-Chan]] and I made up, there's already a simple one: "_siafirën sian_." (Blue sapphires.) Say it five times fast. Betcha mess up. :p
