## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] muses:

> Perhaps... but then we've got to make up all the sword-words while there are still plenty of other words that don't have... words. Like... mouse. Or something. You know?

not at all! The main reason we have so many sword words isn't because of simply having many designs over the years, but many languages that we borrowed names from for their more unique designs. If Hyrule only has a few types of swords, they may only have a few words for them!
