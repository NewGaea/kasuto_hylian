I meant that ELVES thinks that it's ugly, and (I might have read too much Tolkien) I just didn't want to create a language that elves would think of as distasteful, though I'm not that fond of uvular sounds as well. Yeah, I know I'm weard. I'm speaking uvular r's myself. :mrgreen: Anyways, when we see the nature they live in, I don't think uvular sounds in their language would be likely :roll: , but it's your language.
