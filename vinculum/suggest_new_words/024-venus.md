## Venus, Queen of Faeries notes:

I've got it documented... actually, I've got a huge chart of all of Kasuto's words in alphabetical order (English alphabet, anyway), then color coded for what part of speech it is.... Underneath that, I've got mine and KChan's words, and the ones we thought up together, organized the same way... I don't think I have anyone else's, though.
