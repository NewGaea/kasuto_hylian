## The [[qbri|QBri]] uses Ret-Con:

Okay, here's what I've altered since I forgot about the "all pronouns end in -u" rule:

* me - **mëu** (meh-ooh)
* you - **tau**
* us - **nëu**
* you guys - **vëu**

If nobody has any objections with these forms then I'll go ahead and use them myself! Thanks for the comment Venus!
