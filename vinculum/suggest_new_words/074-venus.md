## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] welcomes:

Hello and welcome to the forums, [[qbri|QBri]]!! \^\_\^

First of all, lemme blatantly suck up to you and say that I'm glad that (a) you've decided to post here first and (b) you know what you're talking about! I really do appreciate it.

I'm not saying you're right, and I'm not saying you're wrong, but maybe using the direct object particle before the pronoun like this is just one of those things about Hylian that's weird to foreigners. Personally, I accept a lot of that. Makes it more challenging and more fun, like it's really a real language. ^_^

Okay, now one quick (and small, painless) correction: "me" (in English) is still a pronoun, so its Hylian equivalent would have to end in -u. Same for you (your objective form already does, but I'm just pointing it out anyway), us and you all.

I wish I could discuss this in further detail with you, but I don't have all the answers (since I didn't make this up, after all). Keep posting, though! I'd like to hear more from you!
