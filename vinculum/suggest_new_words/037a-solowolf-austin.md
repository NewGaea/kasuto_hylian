These words are not grammatical, but could be massaged into usable forms

Also, all of your suggestions step on the toes of either official words or obvious borrowings from the games, [[038-venus|as Venus points out below.]] I hope you are able to make some contributions, though!

| Gloss | Official | Your Proposal | => | Grammatical |
|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| **sword** | _kishoke_ | _gladius_ | => | _gladie_ |
| **father** | _piÃ¡ntile_ | _patrus_ | => | _patre_ |
| **to conquer** | _ushikag_ | _victore_ | => | _victorag_ |
