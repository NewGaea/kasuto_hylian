Not bad, breaking it down into three parts:

* _damie_ - a pet or animal companion
* _najhe_ - a field or pasture
* _folkag_ - to roll or spin about

> **igámobondozisag**
> to light something important on fire

Also useful, breaking this down to:

* _iga_ - sealed, locked away, forbidden
* _mobonde_ - lore, legendary knowledge, research findings
* _zisag_ - to start a fire, to burn
