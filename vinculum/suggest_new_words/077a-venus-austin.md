## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] wonders:

> Merriam Webster Online (what I use to double check parts of speech) says _here_ and _there_ are adverbs. o\_o I don't understand that, because you'd think "here" would take the place of "this place" and "there" would take the place of "that place", but maybe since "this" and "that" are adjectives, "here" and "there" MUST be adverbs. \@\_\@ Yay English. I really need to take some linguistics courses. What about a word for *way* over there? Can we have one of those? I like those.

You mean a word for "_yonder?_"
