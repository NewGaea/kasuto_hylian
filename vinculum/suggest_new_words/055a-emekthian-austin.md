## [[emekthian]] suggests:

> How about using the suffix _-zwa_ as a superlative, and not having a comparative at all? E.G. _nasunazwa,_ "darkest" or "darker".

AS: I see the idea you're going for here, but I actually think we can simply use _Venus'_ augmentative and dimiunitive prefixes as comparatives like so:

* dÃ«ne-: a smaller or lesser amount
* mahe-: a larger or greater amount
