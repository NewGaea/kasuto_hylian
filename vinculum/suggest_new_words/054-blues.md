## [[blues-brother|Blues Brother]] dodges:

I am going to help, but I listed them so I can look for them when I want to try and think of things to translate them to Hylian... I mean.... I listed some of the words I wanted to get translated, so I would not forget them, then, you guys might beat me to the punch... Or maybe just... I don't know. I am searching for something for spirit right now... I am not THAT lazy.

EDIT:

supiritto,
seirei,
iki,
seishou,
shinzui,
konjou


Those are Japanese for Spirit, I shal look for others now. X3 I am just getting a bases for the Hylian words, later I shall add the little parts like the e after vowels... or however that rule went...


EDITEDIT: Found Rock... Found an online Japanese dictionary. XD I love the japanese language. XD Will look for latin next. Promise. XD


yurasu,
yusaburu,
yusuburu,
iwa,
rokku,
ganseki

EDITEDITEDIT: Nevermind, here, I'llpost the dictionary site too. X3 HAs lotsa languages, not just Japnese. X3
