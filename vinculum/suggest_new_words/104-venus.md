## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] updates:

I said I had a .doc and a .txt available for copies of both sets of words. I've updated it so that I have .html and .txt files of both. Sorry, Magnas. (You can still practice!)

Kasuto's list of words that I uploaded to the site is a bit outdated; there were lots of mistakes, and words I shouldn't have included. So, if you want copies of anything (not like anyone's actually reading this post, lol. I'm just damned dedicated), PM me for them. Don't rely on what I've uploaded, okay?
