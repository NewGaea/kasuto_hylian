## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] explains:

There are already words for sword, father AND conquer (they're _kishoke, piántile_ and _ushikag,_ respectively). Besides, you don't want the words to be too close to any real language (living or dead).

> AS: This is not necessarily true -- cognates, and false cognates, are a real phenomenon, so having some words close to prior languages, and even having a meaning that sounds similar, is not a huge problem. Just look at _toëre_ v. _tierra_ or _kisame_ v. _kisame_ -- even the numbers show a strong PIE bias.
