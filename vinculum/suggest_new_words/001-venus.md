I'm copying my post from St. Patrick's Day.... maybe it'll inspire someone.

**trèowe** (TREH-oh-way; not to be confused with troe): Old English for faithful. Modern English: trust. Hylian suggestion: trust.

**trèowag** (TREH-oh-wahg): to trust.

**potëra** (poh-TEH-rah): Hylian suggestion: strong. Latin: "potere" was "potent." I just changed the ending to make it an adjective. Modern English: power.

**geleáfae** (Gay-lay-AH-fah-ay): Old English: "geleafa" was "belief." Changed ending to noun. Modern English: belief. Hylian suggestion: belief.

**geleafag** (Gay-lay-AH-fahg): to believe.

**luberag** (loo-BAY-rahg): Latin: "lubere" was "to please." Hylian suggestion: to please.

**malanmale** (Mah-lahn-MAH-lay) or **mámale** (MAH-mah-lay): million. Derived from "malan malën," or "a thousand thousands." I like "mámale" better because it's shorter, and it's got the accent mark, which would make it an exception to the "rule" of no accent marks (save the ë) in numbers. Exceptions are good.
