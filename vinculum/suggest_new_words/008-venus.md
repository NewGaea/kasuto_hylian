New word: **këwle** for fish. Olua made it up, not me. It was actually the result of a typo. Anyway, it's pronounced "KEHW-lay." Um, if that's sort of difficult to figure out (cuz it looks that way), it's like "keh-oo-lay," but the first two syllables become one.

I think that it's sort of difficult to pronounce at first, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. If not, I offer "ka•ule" (COW-lay) and "kèule" (KEH-oo-lay) as alternates.
