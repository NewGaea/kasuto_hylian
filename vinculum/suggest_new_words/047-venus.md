I guess a faerie flew around this section and gave it a couple more hearts. ^_^;;

So, I'm still working on that huge list of vocabulary that Kasuto made up. I went through all the pages of the Hylian Language Institute with a fine-toothed comb (again), picking up any words I could find. Turns out, there are over a hundred words that are not included in the dictionary.

I'm taking it upon myself to write up a new dictionary for the HLI, with all those words included. When I'm done, I'll upload it as a .txt file. The upside of this is that you can get to it -- all the words at once -- whenever you want. The downside of this is that the Hylian font will not be included (since you can only have one style of text in a .txt file), and the parts of speech will not be italicized. If you want the .doc file that I'm writing, which will include all of that, you can PM me when I'm finished. I'll also be making a version that includes our suggestions. However, I won't be uploading that. I'll be updating it constantly to keep up with the changes that we make in this thread, so if you'd like that at any time, you can PM me for that, too. That'll be available as either a .txt file or a .doc file, whatever you want. \^\_\^
