First of all, I gotta give **[K-Chan](contributors/k-chan)** all the credit in the world for this, because if she didn't say anything to me, I wouldn't be about ready to burst right now. So, moka aroti, K-chan'kumi!

Down to business.

K-Chan'kumi said she was bored, so she made up a couple of words in Hylian. They were mostly for clothes, and they all had the letters "ok" in them. She told me "shirt" would be "**soke**."

> **soke** (SOH-kay): shirt

Meanwhile, I was looking at my blog, which happens to have a picture of Link on it. He's shooting an arrow. I wondered to myself, "Well, how would you say tunic? A tunic is like a big shirt...." I don't know how, but I instantly thought that instead of words, there should be a prefix to indicate size (not suffixes, because those indicate parts of speech). I thought of "**ma**" for "big" and "**dën**" for "small." Therefore, a tunic would be "**masoke**," or literally, "big shirt." (A baby-doll tee, on the other hand, would be a **dënsoke**.) 

Also, the more you say the prefix, the more you exaggerate the size. Like mamamasoke would be a REALLY big shirt. On top of that, the size is relative. Little Link's tunic would still be called a masoke, because it's a big shirt to him, but if Adult Link were to try and squeeze his way into clothes he wore seven years ago, his head would get stuck inside the dënsoke.

K-chan'kumi also thought up a few more words: Leggings (**nonoke**), undergarments (**usheoke**), boots (**kamoke**), gloves (**namoke**). I told her she forgot "hat," but I came right up with that one: "**chapoke** (can't wait for that CH letter!)," from the French chapeau.

Something was wrong, though. The undergarments didn't look right to me. I thought perhaps there should be a way to tell men's undergarments from women's undergarments, because they're not quite the same, lol.

This is where I got my inspiration. "_Dege_" is Hylian for "deity." We change "_dege_" to "_dégine_" for "goddess" and to "_dégile_" for "god." We have "_kímino•i_" for "little girl" and "_kímilo•i_" for "little boy." Obviously, the N and the L are for girls and boys, respectively. I thought, why not make the N and L prefixes, too? Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "**nusheoke**" for "girls' underclothes" and "**lusheoke**" for "boys' underclothes." "**Usheoke**" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "**dënnusheoke**" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::

Of course, there are two SMALL problems with what I've done.... One: the double n in "_**dënnusheoke**_." Every letter in Hylian is supposed to be pronounced. How do you pronounce two Ns in a row? Two: the N and L prefixes only work for nouns that start with a vowel. What about the ones that start in consonants? I was thinking an apostrophe might work, but then again, it might not. "**N'kamoke**" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

But, that's what we've come up with. What do you guys think?
