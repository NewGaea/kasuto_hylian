## [[qbri|QBri]] concedes:

I agree with everything you say Venus.

You're right, **bëu** /bëu/ (don't wanna bother adding in the dots at the moment \[Austin Springer: added them for archival\]) does make more sense. Let's use it and I guess that that's all for now.

just as a reminder, here's the prepositions we got:

to, for - _ank_
on, in - _ont_
in, at (used for time) - _ënt_
of - _daia_
from - _doia_
with - _**tok**_

some new ones:
until - **jade** (comb. of "gis"(esp.) and "made"(jap.)
for (on behalf of) - **pro**
than - **ol** (from esp. "ol")
