Family terms (inspired because I was reviewing this thread and found there are no terms for family AND because I'm writing a fic called Family Ties, which includes some very interesting family relationships....):

Just wondering if kímilo•i and kímino•i are only used as forms of address. Probably, since they end in I.

But, um, suggestions for "son" and "daughter" if those are only terms of address: "hiósile" for son (or boy) and "hiósine" for daughter (or girl), with "hiose" for just a regular old child. So "bagu'san hiósilën" would be "my boys," which would probably be understood as "my sons."

Here, I've got some more now that you're nice and warmed up and in my groove:

* Source: Merriam-Webster OnLine
  * PARENT, _piante_: _piántine_, _piántile_ (_piantën_) [Kasuto's original]
  * CHILD, **hiose**: **hiósine**, **hiósile** (**hiosën**) From Greek _hyios_, for son.
  * SIBLING, **sipe**: **sípine**, **sípile** (**sipën**) From Old German _sippa_, for kinship.
  * GRANDCHILD, **napete**: **napétine**, **napétile** (**napetën**) From Sanskrit _napAt_, for grandson.
  * SPOUSE, **ipae**: **ipáine**, **ipáile** (**ipaën**) From Hittite _sipant_- for spouse.
  * UNCLE/AUNT, **amite**: **amítine**, **amítile** (**amitën**) From Latin _amita_, for aunt. Source: Me. I study languages. o.o
  * GRANDPARENT, **sofe**: **sófine**, **sófile** (**sofën**) From Japanese _sofu_, for grandfather.
  * COUSIN, **itoke**: **itókine**, **itókile** (**itokën**) From Japanese _itoko_, for cousin.
  * NEPHEW/NIECE, **sobre**: **sóbrine**, **sóbrile** (**sobrën**) From Spanish _sobrino_, for nephew.

Great- (as in great-grandfather or great-aunt): _ma'_ (so that great-grandfather would be "masófile") From my previous suggestion for "big."
Half- (as in half-sister): _dëna'_ (so that half-sister would be "dënasípine") From my previous suggestion for "little." I'm changing "little/small" from "dën" to "dëna" since it's an adjective, and all adjetives must end in A.
Note: "ma" and "dëna" in these cases would not mean "big" or "little," but indicate more of a hierarchy of terms. "**Dënasípine**," then, would not mean "little sister" or "younger sister", but rather "half sister", indicating that one is not as close to a half sister as a full sister. Similarly, "**masófile**" would not indicate one's elder grandfather, but rather, someone older THAN one's grandfather, who should be one's grandfather's father, or one's great-grandfather. Don't worry about it if I've confused you. It's just one of those weird things about language. Trust me when I say that it makes perfect sense in my head. But if you do understand it, then good for you! You can help me explain it to others! ^_^

Step- (e.g., stepfather): **ipa'** (stepfather is "ipapiántile") From "**ipae**", previously mentioned to mean "spouse." "**Ipapiántile**" would have a literal translation as "spouse-father," which could be interpreted as a father-by-marriage, which is precisely what a stepfather is. I suppose it could also refer to inlaws, and differentiated by context. Haven't exactly worked this one out.

So what do you all think? :::grins proudly:::
