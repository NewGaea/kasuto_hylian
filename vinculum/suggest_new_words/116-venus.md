Random numbers are COOL. Yay for the American and Hylian systems of measuring distance!

So I'm guessing that this leto would be the standard unit of measure -- like our mile -- because you've got "big" and "small" versions of it. Also, a chuka is exactly 9 feet. Neat!

Oh, and stick Es on the ends of all the words because they're nouns. :::nod:::
