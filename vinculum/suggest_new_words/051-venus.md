## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] offers:

Here's a incomplete list of what we need:

* Directions (up, down, left, right, forward, back, compass points)
* Common creatures (cuccos, keese, guays, tektites)
* Geographical features (mountains, valleys)
* Weather (rain, snow)
* Anatomy (head, shoulders, knees, toes)
* Clothing (shirt, pants, skirt, jacket)
* Emotional/Physical conditions (sad, angry, alone, wet, injured, cold)
* Superlatives (e.g., high/higher/highest)

We *do* have some of these things... like rain, head, shoe, you know. But ifyou could just list things, we'll either take them or assign the word to something else (if the English word you chose to translate is already translated).
