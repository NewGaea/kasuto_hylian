> _Katene_ could mean broadsword, which is what the Master Sword is. While _kishoke_ could be the generic word.

AS: I like the idea, but _broadsword_ is actually a word that means nothing in historical terms -- it could be a bastard sword, though, which is a sword suitable for use in either one or two hands.
