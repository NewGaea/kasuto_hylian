## The [[qbri|QBri]] uses Ret-Con:

Okay, here's what I've altered since I forgot about the "all pronouns end in -u" rule:

* me - **mÃ«u** (meh-ooh) ğŸ›‘
* you - **tau** ğŸ›‘
* us - **nÃ«u** ğŸ›‘
* you guys - **vÃ«u** ğŸ›‘

If nobody has any objections with these forms then I'll go ahead and use them myself! Thanks for the comment Venus!

### Austin Springer injects:

Ultimately, I dislike them, but would suggest that if they are incorporated, we simply make compounds with the particle: _ab bagu_ becomes _abagu_, _ab taiu_ becomes _abaiu_ or _adaiu_ (I like the idea of a phonological process responsible for shortening these compound words), _ab nosu_ becomes _amnosu_, _ab vosu_ becomes _avosu_, and then we may as well include _abru_, _absÃ«ru_, and _abÃ«ru_ plus their plural forms. This creates a table like so:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person</th>
    <th colspan=2>Singular</th>
    <th colspan=2>Plural</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Nominative</th>
    <th>Accusative</th>
    <th>Nominative</th>
    <th>Accusative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>First</th>
    <td>bagu</td>
    <td>abagu</td>
    <td>nosu</td>
    <td>amnosu</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Second</th>
    <td>taiu</td>
    <td>adaiu</td>
    <td>vosu</td>
    <td>avosu</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Third, Neuter</th>
    <td>ru</td>
    <td>abru</td>
    <td>iru</td>
    <td>abiru</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Third, Masculine</th>
    <td>Ã«ru</td>
    <td>abÃ«ru</td>
    <td>iÃ«ru</td>
    <td>abiÃ«ru</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Third, Feminine</th>
    <td>sÃ«ru</td>
    <td>absÃ«ru</td>
    <td>siÃ«ru</td>
    <td>absiÃ«ru</td>
  </tr>
</table>
