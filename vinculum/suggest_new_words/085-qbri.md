## [[qbri|QBri]] observes:

The way I see it, adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all follow a regular pattern (-a for adjectives, -e for nouns, -ag for verbs, -ok for adverbs) so that leaves conjunctions and prepositions with no standard (which is what Kasuto seems to have done intentionally, considering **the conjunctions and prepositions he's created don't follow any pattern**) so I think we should just go with what we know. And what we do know is that Kasuto left no specific instructions for conjunctions or prepositions. Which is personally fine with me, since there's a lot less conjunctions and prepositions than any of the other categories. So it'll be easy to learn the conjunctions and prepositions, without having to rely on a certain system.

Just my thoughts.
