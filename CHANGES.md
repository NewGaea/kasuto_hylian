## 2023-Jul-01

The language maintenance has been officially handed off from **Austin Springer** to **Jerin of Calatia.** We have established **The Hylian Linguistic Society** as a means of welcoming in new contributors.

+ **Vocative Case** has been added for nouns. This gives the language a way to grammatically mark proper names, rather than having names which may appear to be of various parts of speech, such as *Zelda, Impa* (adjective), _Rauru, Nabooru_ (pronoun), _Ruto, Mido_ (preposition), _Ganon, Malon, Talon_ (unknown)
	+ Now all names end in one of three forms: \<-ur\>, \<-ai\>, or \<-oi\>
	+ Personal names also end with a gender suffix preceding the Vocative ending
	+ There is a new gender suffix for personal names which are not gendered: \<-eth\>
+ **New words** added to Jerin's personal lexicon
	+ **kontrakakira** and **konktrakakire** added for _orthographic_ and _orthography_, meaning "correct writing."
