# CHANGELOG

The following are lists of changes made to the Hylian Language since 2023-Jul-01, with the newest and most relevant changes listed nearest to the top.

## 2024-01-09

### Official change to V3 labeling
Changeover to Version numbers:
- Version 1 (V1) is labeled *Kasutan Modern Hylian* and contains only the documentation from [Kasuto.net](https://kasuto.net) and archived content from the Vinculum
- Version 2 (V2) is the incomplete solo work of Austin Springer and New Gaea Entertainment, and is labeled *Austinian Modern Hylian*. This documentation is, again, incomplete, but may be fleshed out somewhat.
- **Version 3** (V3) is labeled as *Neo-Modern Hylian* and currently contains the archives of past efforts, while focusing on a more consistent direction forward. All **new** work from 2023 and onwards should be in V3 until such a time as V4 is established.
### Words of the Day
While we are still a bit behind on documentation, words of the day from September-December 2023 are being processed. Most words of the day in early 2024 are intended to build on existing words, expanding them with polysemy, or possibly coining new words through deconstruction of existing words.

## 2023-Jul-01

The language maintenance has been officially handed off from **Austin Springer** to **Jerin of Calatia.** We have established **The Hylian Linguistic Society** as a means of welcoming in new contributors.

+ **Vocative Case** has been added for nouns. This gives the language a way to grammatically mark proper names, rather than having names which may appear to be of various parts of speech, such as *Zelda, Impa* (adjective), _Rauru, Nabooru_ (pronoun), _Ruto, Mido_ (preposition), _Ganon, Malon, Talon_ (unknown)
	+ Now all names end in one of three forms: \<-ur\>, \<-ai\>, or \<-oi\>
	+ Personal names also end with a gender suffix preceding the Vocative ending
	+ There is a new gender suffix for personal names which are not gendered: \<-eth\>
+ **New words** added to Jerin's personal lexicon
	+ **kontrakakira** and **konktrakakire** added for _orthographic_ and _orthography_, meaning "correct writing."
