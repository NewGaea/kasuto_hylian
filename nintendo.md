# Nintendo

**Nintendo** is the company responsible for developing, licensing, and publishing _The Legend of Zelda_ games. While they are not active contributors to the Hylian Language, the HLS considers them to be the source of any word which can be traced back to the games themselves, such as names of individuals, tribes, species, races, and enemies, the [[lore/rúpie|rupee]] currency, and to have a role in the  terms such as _Heart Container, Stamina Vessel,_ or _Death Mountain,_ among others.

## "Contributions" from Nintendo

When included as a contributor to a word or phrase, the HLS believes that **Nintendo** should be stylized in _Emphasis_ and before any other contributor. The project would not exist without **Nintendo's** games (hence listing them first), but is not endorsed by them (hence emphasis or italic formatting).

This credit should apply even to terms like **trofashe** or **Vïlae daz Haikásule daia Hirule** which use Hylian elements to recompose a word beyond merely transliterating and grammaticalizing it.
