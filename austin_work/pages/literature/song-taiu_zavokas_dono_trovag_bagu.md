# TAIU ZAVOKAS DONO TROVAG BAGU<br />(You Know Where to Find Me)

Bagu miares taiu'sa akonde duras zatiudre /
Ëstatok kibares doia sia ank gia /
Jade hire via hire taz sesolën kibares ank andankvën ont taiu'sa andwe /
Bagu naipas kwa has toe bagu panktënt dag pro tau /
Bagu naipas kwa bagu panktënt izag taz ite pro tau /
Sëk bagu naz sëntes berëk trok hakwa /
Tairas uz taiu tairas onkvas anta bagu /
Ëk bagu shi atemptas sëk taiu naz panktas miarag /
Has toe tënas ank tau trok nathok /
Taro zu tairas toka bagu jhatos ank tau zanasune

[I saw your sky fall (down) today] /
[Suddenly turn(change) from blue to gray] /
[Till' one by one the rain turned to tears on your face] /
[Wish that there was something I could have done for you] /
[With that I could have eased the pain for you] /
[But I did not feel ever so helpless "But I've never felt so helpless"] /
[It is as/like you are drowning before/in front of me] /
[And I'm reaching-out but you can't see] /
[There-is something holding to you so tightly/closely] /
[So (I guess) this is all I will say/speak to you tonight]

CHORUS:

At taiu berëk rekwas bëu, taiu zavokas dono trovag bëu /
Bagu tairos matsa, dono bagu tokakrone tairënt /
At taiu berëk rekwas bëu, taiu zavokas dono trovag bëu /
Bagu bokakrone silrënt tau, bagu tairas dono bagu tokakrone tairënt /
Chirkau ank tau

[If you ever need/require me, you know where to find me] /
[I will be waiting, where I have always been] /
[If you ever need/require me, you know where to find me] /
[I have never left you, I'm where I have always been] /
[Next/nearby to you]
