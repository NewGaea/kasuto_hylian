A very convenient aspect of the Hylian language is that all verbs follow a regular conjugation pattern.

First off, you must know what a conjugated verb is. A conjugated verb is a verb which has changed it form to reflect some detail of state, tense, mood, or person. In Hylian, verbs conjugate for the dimensions of _state_, _tense_ and _mood_. The root form of a verb in Hylian is the _infinitive_, which translates into English most often in the form of "_to **verb**_." Here is a sample of conjugations for the word "eat" in English:

**Conjugations of Eat**

- **Infinitive**: _To eat or not to eat, 'tis but idle hunger._
- **Present Tense**: _I eat, he eats, join the party!_
- **Past Tense**: _I have eaten many things, but I only ate once today._
- **Future Tense**: _I will eat the cake, but I will not eat the pie._

In English, verbs conjugate in many dimensions, and they are not always obvious, nor is it well taught what the proper conjugation for every combination of them is. The simplest chart of conjugations in English is for _person_ and _tense_:

- **Singular Present**: I am, you are, he is
- **Plural Present**: We are, you are, they are

<!--
A conjugated verb is one that takes a subject; it is doing something. For example: I eat food. In this sentence, the verb eat is conjugated, it takes the subject I. Any unconjugated verb is called an infinitive. In English, the infinitive usually looks like to be or to eat, with the preposition to indicating that it is infinitive. Look at this example: Verb: to be Conjugations: I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, you are, they are. In English, to be is irregular because it does not follow the normal pattern of adding an -s to the third person singular.
-->

In Hylian, all verbs are regular. That means that they all follow the same conjugation pattern. Each tense has a unique ending that is only used for that verb, and not for any other type of word. Here are the endings for Hylian verbs, using _tairag_ (to be) as an example.

* **Infinitive**: _tair_ + _-ag_ = _tairag_ (to be)
* **Present**: _tair_ + _-as_ = _tairas_ (am, are, is)
* **Past**: _tair_ + _-es_ = _taires_ (was, were)
* **Future**: _tair_ + _-os_ = _tairos_ (will be)

In addition, you can create a perfect state, indicating if an action is completed or not, simply by replacing the _-s_ at the end of these tenses with _-nt_.

* **Present Perfect**: _tair_ + _-ant_ = _tairant_ (have been)
* **Past Perfect**: _tair_ + _-ent_ = _tairent_ (had been)
* **Future Perfect**: _tair_ + _-ont_ = _tairont_ (will have been)

Finally, you can easily create an imperative mood, or turn a verb into a command, with the same process:

* **Present Imperative**: _tair_ + _ans_ = _tairans_ (make it be so)
* **Past Imperative**: _tair_ + _ens_ = _tairens_ (commanded it be so)
* **Future Imperative**: _tair_ + _ons_ = _tairons_ (will make it be so)

> **Note**: While the past and future imperative forms are not canonical to Kasuto's description of the language, they are sensible given the patterns presented above. For fully canonical use of this Hylian language, the _past_ and _future_ forms of the imperative will not be elaborated upon.

<!--
=ag
-ag
t@rag
Infinitive ending. To be.
=as
-as
t@ras
Present tense. (you) are.
=es
-es
t@res
Past tense. (you) were.
=os
-os
t@ros
Future tense. (you) will be.
=ant
-ant
t@rant
Present perfect tense. (you) have been.
=Ent
-ënt
t@rEnt
Past perfect tense. (you) had been.
=ont
-ont
t@ront
Future perfect tense. (you) will have been.
=ans
-ans
t@rans
Imperative mood, a command. (you) be
-->

These endings, listed above, are unique only to verbs. That means that a word that ends in _-as_ can only be a verb that is in the present tense. This makes understanding a word's part of speech very easy.

In English it can be very difficult to tell what a word means if it is out of context. Take turn for example. It can be a verb: "I turn," or it can be a noun: "a left turn." As in English, a verb must have an explicit subject or an understood one. For example: "I run." The subject of that sentence is _I_. The subject was explicitly stated. Here is an example of an understood subject: "Run." In that sentence, the subject _you_ was understood because it was a command.

Hylian works in the same way, however because Hylian does not conjugate for person or number, the verb ending for each tense stays the same regardless of who is doing the action.

- bagu t@ras (bagu tairas) \> I am
- t@u t@ras (taiu tairas) \> You (singular) are
- Eru t@ras (ëru tairas) \> He is
- nosu t@ras (nosu tairas) \> We are
- vosu t@ras (vosu tairas) \> You (plural) are
- iEru t@ras (iëru tairas) \> They are

Notice that the -as ending didn't change even when the subject changed. This rule stays the same for all verbs in all tenses. In certain cases, a subject is not needed. In commands, or in sentences with more than one verb and the subject doesn't change, the subject need only be stated once. Take these examples:

```
bagu koemes Ek goeares ab taz koeme.
Bagu koemes ëk goeares az koeme.
I ate and (I) liked the food.

lintans ab jhatag hilane.
Lintans ab jhatag hilane.
(You) Learn (how) to speak Hylian.
```

## Tense

The most important aspect of a verb in Hylian is its tense. The tense tells when the action happened. I reviewed the tenses above, but I will now explain them in further detail.

### Verb Tenses

- Present Tense - Krone Akantroshe
  - =as (-as)
  - This describes an action that is happening now. When people talk, most of what they say is in the present tense.
  - `bagu tairas fëlzana > I am happy`
  - Note: This is the pure form of the verb, the progressive, I am eating, will be explained later.
- Past tense - Krone Depotroshe
  - =es (-es)
  - This describes an action that happened sometime in the past; it may or may not have been completed.
  - `Bagu koemes az koeme > I ate the food`
- Future tense - Krone Baakantroshe
  - =os (-os)
  - This describes an action that will take place sometime in the future. Please note that English uses the helping verb will to express the future tense, Hylian does not use a helping verb; it simply changes the ending of the infinitive.
  - `Bagu jhatos ak sëru > I will speak to her`.
- Present perfect tense - Krone Akantroshe da.ia Kimare
  - =ant (-ant)
  - This describes an action that has been completed in the past. In English, the present tense of the verb _have_ is used as a helping verb along with the past participle, Hylian does not use helping verbs to form any of the perfect tenses, and the past participle does not exist in Hylian.
  - `Bagu miarant ab ru > I have seen it`
  - `Ëru miarant ab ru > He has seen it`
- Past perfect tense - Krone Depotroshe da.ia Kimare
  - =Ent (-ënt)
  - This describes an action that was completed in the past, and completed before another said action. In English, it is usually formed with the helping verb had.
  - `Bagu yaz koemënt az koeme depoto sëru yovtes > I had already eaten the food before she arrived`
- Future perfect tense - Krone Baakantroshe da.ia Kimare
  - =ont (-ont)
  - This describes an action that will be completed in the future, before another future action.
  - `Link yovtos ënt taz minaze ëk bagu torimont ab bagu'sa tïnske. > Link will arrive in the morning and I will have finished my work`
- Imperative mood - Sënte Jushipe
  - =ans (-ans)
  - Strictly speaking, this is not a _tense_, it is a _mood_. The verb itself does not have a time of occurrence, but it is understood to take place in the present. The imperative mood is used to give a command to someone. In English, the subject you is understood, and is not usually stated. In Hylian, the subject (whom you are giving the command to) does not need to be stated, if it can be determined by context, i.e. you're talking directly to that person. However, the subject can be stated for emphasis or clarification.
  - `(You) Be quiet > (Ta.iu) Ta.irans sikwala`
  - `You (guys, plural) speak quietly > Vosu jhatans sikwalok.`
  - **Special Note**: The imperative mood is also used to give a _nosu_ command. This would be equivalent to the English "Let's (do something)." For example
`Nosu sïlrans > Let's leave`. Notice that in Hylian, the subject _nosu_ is usually stated. However, in certain contexts it can be omitted, i.e. talking directly with each other and there is no ambiguity.

## Objects

Another important aspect of verbs is their objects, either direct or indirect object. A direct object is what the verb affects directly, it usually answers the question _"Who or what?"_ For example:

`Bagu lërdes az lërde > I read the book`

The word "book" is the direct object of the verb "read." It answers the question, "What?"

An indirect object is the person or object that the action was performed for, it answers the questions to whom?, for whom?, to what?, or for what? In an English sentence, the indirect object usually comes before the direct object.

`I gave him the book.` In this example, "book" is the direct object, and "him" is the indirect object.

`I gave the book to him.` This has the exact same meaning as the above sentence, but notice that the indirect object came after the direct object. The indirect object is, in this case, indicated by the preposition "to."

Verbs that take direct objects are called _transitive verbs_, verbs that do not take direct objects are _intransitive verbs_. A transitive verb can have either a direct object or both a direct and an indirect object. An intransitive has either an indirect object or no object at all. Sometimes it can be confusing in sentences with the word "to," because prepositional or adverbial phrases that start with to may not be objects at all.

`They walked to the house.` In this sentence, to the house is not an indirect object because it does not answer "to or for whom or what?" The phrase "to the house" is an _adverbial phrase_ that describes the verb walk. It answers "To where did they walk?"

An adverb answers the question "Where, when, how, or to what extent?" In this sentence, it answers the question "where?" in the form of, "To where did they walk?" Answered by: "They walked to the house."

`She spoke.` In this sentence, the verb spoke is intransitive because it has no direct object.

`She spoke to him.` In this sentence, the verb spoke is also intransitive because it has no direct object. Do note that it still does have an indirect object, to him. This is perfectly acceptable.

`She spoke Hylian.` In this sentence, the verb spoke is transitive because it has the direct object Hylian. The object tells what she spoke.

`She spoke Hylian to him.` In this sentence, the verb spoke is transitive because it has the direct object _Hylian_. But also note that it has the indirect object him. _Hylian_ tells what she spoke, "him" tells to whom she spoke.

Here is an overview of objects in the Hylian language:

In a Hylian sentence, the order is usually `subject, verb, direct object, and indirect object.`

```
bagu diares ab taz lerde ank Eru.
Bagu diares az lërde ank ëru.
I gave the book to him.
```

Hylian sentences use verbal particles to indicate that something is a direct or indirect object.

- Direct object particle
  - ab (ab)
  - This word does not have a literal translation into English. It is used in a sentence to indicate that the **following** word or phrase is the direct object of the verb.
- Indirect object particle
  - ank (ank)
  - This word can be literally translated as "to" or "for." It indicates that the **following** word or phrase is the indirect object of the verb.

## Verbal Adjuncts

There are a few special words in Hylian called verbal adjuncts. They are words that are used in conjunction with a verb to change its meaning. One thing you may notice about Hylian is that there is no present or past participle. For example, in English, the present participle of _do_ is _doing_ and the past participle is _done_. Not having participles can make Hylian confusing to new speakers. However, the verbal adjuncts give the verb a special meaning that correspond to certain conjugations in English. An adjunct is always placed **directly in front of** a conjugated verb. Here are some rules for using adjuncts:

1. An adjunct always comes **directly before** a conjugated verb. If a subject is stated, the adjunct comes between the subject and verb. You can never separate the adjunct from the verb and the adjunct must always come first.

    1. Sometimes a verb can have more than one adjunct modifying it. In this case, both adjuncts must be placed together, and come directly before the verb.

2. Pay close attention to the specific rules for each adjunct. Some adjuncts can be used with all tenses, and some are used with only one verb tense. Using the incorrect verb tense can drastically change the meaning of the sentence.

Below are the verbal adjuncts and their uses:

- Progressive Adjunct - Jhunte Ra.uka
  - Si (shi)
  - This word gives the verb a _progressive_ meaning. In English, the progressive is formed by combining a form of to be with the present participle of a verb. For example: I am reading, I was reading, I will be reading, I have been reading, I had been reading, and I will have been reading. In Hylian, simply add the adjunct _shi_ directly before the verb to create a progressive meaning. The tense of the Hylian verb is the same as the tense of to be in English.
  - `bagu Si lErdas (Bagu shi lërdas) > I am reading`
  - `bagu Si lErdes (Bagu shi lërdes) > I was reading.`
  - `bagu Si lErdos (Bagu shi lërdos) > I will be reading`
  - `bagu Si lErdant (Bagu shi lërdant) > I have been reading.`
  - `bagu Si lErdEnt (Bagu shi lërdënt) > I had been reading.`
  - `bagu Si lErdont (Bagu shi lërdont) > I will have been reading.`
- Imperfect Adjunct - Jhunte Vokimara
  - So (sho)
  - This word gives the verb an _imperfect_ meaning. It is roughly equivalent to saying "used to" in English. It denotes a sense of incompletion or continuity with regard to the past. For all practical purposes, it is used in the same way as "used to." Please note that this adjunct is **only used** with the _past tense_ of the verb.
  - `bagu So lErdes (Bagu sho lërdes) > I used to read.`
- Subjunctive Adjunct - Jhunte Kateha
  - S@ (shai)
  - This word gives the verb a _subjunctive_ meaning. It denotes a sense of uncertainty or conjecture regarding something. In English, the actual subjunctive mood is rarely used. The true subjunctive in English goes like this: `If I were a millionare, I'd buy a mansion.` In this sentence, "if I were" is in the subjunctive mood.
  - The word _shai_ can be more accurately described in terms of the English words "might" and "may." They denote a sense of uncertainty: "I might do it." "He may not be there." In Hylian, the subjunctive adjunct is used when "may" or "might" is used in English. Please note that this adjunct is only used with the present and present perfect tenses.
  - `bagu S@ lErdas (Bagu shai lërdas) > I might (may) read`
  - `bagu S@ lErdant (Bagu shai lërdant) > I might (may) have read.`
- Conditional Adjunct - Jhunte Tashiza
  - SO (shoi)
  - This word gives the verb a _conditional_ meaning. It is equivalent to the English usage of the word "would." It tells what a person would do. `I would go if I had the money.` Notice that the conditional is often used in conjunction with an if clause. Notice also that the conditional adjunct is used only with the present and present perfect tenses.
  - `bagu SO lErdas (Bagu shoi lërdas) > I would read.`
  - `bagu SO lErdant (Bagu shoi lërdant) > I would have read.`
- Imperative Adjunct - Jhunte Jushipa
  - Se (she)
  - This gives the verb an _imperative_ mood. It is used to give a command that is less forceful than using the actual imperative mood. It is equivalent to saying "should" as in `You should not smoke`, or "ought to" as in `You ought to be nice to your brother`. This adjunct is used only with the present and present perfect tenses.
  - `t@u Se lErdas ab za lErde (Taiu she lërdas ab za lërde) > You should (ought to) read this book.`
  - `t@u Se lErdant ab za lErde (Taiu she lërdant ab za lërde) > You should (ought to) have read this book.`
- Super-Imperative Adjunct - Jhunte Mojushipa
  - Sa (sha)
  - This gives the verb an _imperative_ meaning, but it much more forceful than the above adjunct. It tells what a person must do, and is one step down from giving a direct command. It gives a feeling of necessity and duty to the sentence, as in `You must go home.`
  - `t@u Sa lErdas ab za lErde (Taiu sha lërdas ab za lërde) > You must read this book.`
- Conditional Ability Adjunct - Jhunte
  - Su (shu)
  - This is used to say that something _could be done_, but there is some doubt or uncertainty about it. This is different from the verb _panktag_ which denotes definite ability. `Bagu jhatas ab hilana > I can speak Hylian` denotes a sense of certainty and definiteness. `Bagu shu jhatas ab hilana at (bagu) lintes ab ru > I could speak hylian if I learned it` describes the ability to speak Hylian, but with some form of doubt or condition surrounding it. This adjunct is used with the present and present perfect tense, but the verb in the following _if_ clause is often in the past or past perfect tense.
  - `bagu Su Jatas ab hilane at lintes ab ru (Bagu shu jhatas ab hilane at lintes ab ru) > I could speak Hylian if I learned it.`
  - `bagu Su Jatant ab hilane at lintEnt ab ru (Bagu shu jhatant ab hilane at lintënt ab ru) > I could have spoken Hylian if I had learned it.`
- Passive Adjunct - Jhunte Jujowa
  - Siu (shiu)
  - Because there are no participles in Hylian, it makes it difficult to create a sentence with a passive meaning. In English, the passive voice turns what would normally be the subject of the verb into an object. For example, the active voice would be `I read the book`, the passive voice would be `The book was read by me`. The subject "I" becomes the object "me" and the object "book" becomes the subject. In Hylian, the passive voice doesn't work exactly that way. There is no way to say by me. However, a passive meaning can be given to the sentence by adding the adjunct _shiu_.
  - Note: You cannot state who the action was performed by, you can only state what the action was performed upon. It would be something like this: `Taz lërde shiu lërdes > The book was read`. This adjunct is roughly equivalent to the impersonal _se_ in Spanish.
  - `taz lErde siu lErdas (Taz lërde shiu lërdas) > The book is read`
  - `taz lErde Siu lErdes (Taz lërde shiu lërdes) > The book was read`
  - `taz lErde Siu lErdos (Taz lërde shiu lërdos) > The book will be read`
  - `taz lErde Siu lErdant (Taz lërde shiu lërdant) > The book has been read`
  - `taz lErde Siu lErdEnt (Taz lërde shiu lërdënt) > The book had been read`
  - `taz lErde Siu lErdont (Taz lërde shiu lërdont) > The book will have been read`
- Reflexive Adjunct - Jhunte Riuka
  - Site (shite)
  - This adjunct makes the verb reflexive. It reflects the action of the verb back to the subject. It would be like saying "He -verb- himself" or "He -verb- to himself". The reflexive adjunct is usually used a lot more commonly in Hylian than the -self pronouns are in English. However, many instances of this adjunct can be understood by context, so they don't always have to be used.

## Negating a Verb

One more important fact about Hylian verbs is how to negate a verb. To negate a verb means to make it negative. In English, this is usually done by adding the helping verb do + not. For example: I do not read. In Hylian, a verb is negated by placing the word _naz_ in between the subject and verb (if there is an adjunct, it is placed before the adjunct).

```
bagu naz lErdes az lerde.
Bagu naz lërdes az lërde.
I did not read the book.

Eru naz SO lErdas az lerde.
Ëru naz shoi lërdas az lërde.
He would not read the book.
```

Please note that the word naz is only used for negating a verb, and is not use for anything else. If you want to say "no" as a response to a question or as an interjection, use the word _nani_.

```
nani, bagu naz koemos az koeme.
Nani, bagu naz koemos az koeme.
No, I will not eat the food.
```

## Passive Voice

An unusual aspect of Hylian verbs is that there is no true passive voice. In English, the passive voice is used by combining the verb _be_ with the past participle of a verb. Because Hylian has no participles, it is impossible to write a purely passive sentence. However, to give a sentence a passive meaning, the passive adjunct _shiu_ is used. The denotes that the subject takes on the meaning of an object. Read the adjuncts section for further explanation.

## Pro-verb

Do not confuse a pro-verb with a proverb. A proverb is a short saying or quote, a pro-verb is a verb that takes the place of another verb or verb phrase in a sentence. This is used frequently in English, but most speakers don't even know that they are doing it. For example: `I completed my work just like he did`. The word _did_ takes the place of the verb _completed_. This sentence could have also been written `I completed my work just like he completed (his)`. English-speakers often use a form of the verb _do_ as a pro-verb.

Hylian uses the regular verb _dag_ as its pro-verb, it is conjugated just like any other verb in all tenses.

```
bagu biankes az trofaSe, lo masan Aktriu des.
Bagu biankes az trofashe, lo masan äktriu des.
I sought the Triforce, as many others did (as did many others).
```
