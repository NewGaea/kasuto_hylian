A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. An important characteristic of Hylian nouns is that the vast majority of them follow a regular pattern. Unlike English, in which nouns can have almost any ending, Hylian nouns all have the same ending. Plurality is also indicated by a regular pattern. Below are the two noun endings.

- Singular Nouns
  - -e (-e)
  - All regular singular nouns have an -e ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -e can only be a singular noun and nothing else. Here are examples of singular nouns:
    - `lërde (lërde) = book`
    - `brinste (brinste) = arm`

- Plural Nouns
  - -ën (-ën)
  - All regular plural nouns have an -ën ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -ën can only be a plural noun and nothing else. Here are examples of plural nouns:
    - `lërdën (lërdën) = books`
    - `Brinstën (brinstën) = arms`

## Gender

Many languages, such as Spanish and French, assign nouns a grammatical gender. For example, the Spanish word _lapíz_, which means "pencil," is masculine; while the word _fotografía_, which means "photograph," is feminine. If this makes no sense to you, then you're in good company: only about half of all languages on Earth use such a system in the broadest sense. In some of these languages, grammatical gender is assigned to all words, even inanimate objects. However, in English, words have no grammatical gender. They only have a natural gender, i.e. "woman" is feminine, and "man" is masculine. Hylian also uses natural gender for words. It has an invariable definite article which does not change with gender. There are gender neutral words, as well as gender specific words, as in English. There is a regular way of turning a gender neutral word into a gender specific word. Here are some examples:

- `lërde	(lërde)	> book` (Gender neutral)
- `piante	(piante)	> parent` (Gender neutral)
- `piántile	(piántile) > father` (masculine)
- `piántine	(piántine) > mother` (feminine)

### Forming Gender-Specific Words

Forming a gender-specific noun conforms to a regular pattern. It involves taking the word stem and adding a suffix. When a gender suffix is added to the word, please note that an accent mark is added to preserve the stress of the original word. Here is an example using _dege_, which means "deity" or "god".

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only nouns can take a gender-specific subject, adjectives don't. When using an adjective to describe a gender-specific noun, the adjective only has to agree in number.

- **Neutral Word: Stem + Suffix + e = New Word**
  - `dege: deg + -il + e = dëgile`
  - `dege: deg + -in + e = dëgine`

- **Original Word: Definition \> New Word: Definition**
  - `dege: Deity (neutral) > dëgile: god (masculine)`
  - `dege: Deity (neutral) > dëgine: goddess (feminine)`

## Topicality

Hylian is a topic marking language, meaning that any noun which serves as a topic of discussion gets a special marking. While this marking is broadly ignored in writing, which generally has a clear flow of content along a given topic, in speech it is more widely used, and authors wishing to write dialogue are advised to know the differences.

- Singular Nouns
  - -i (-i)
  - All topical singular nouns have an -i ending. While other parts of speech may end with /i/, most words ending in /i/ are topical (or polite, see below) nouns. Here are examples of topical singular nouns:
    - `lërdi (lërdi) = book`
    - `brinsti (brinsti) = arm`

- Plural Nouns
  - -ïn (-ïn)
  - All topical plural nouns have an -ïn ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -ïn can only be a plural noun and nothing else. Here are examples of plural nouns:
    - `lërdïn (lërdïn) = books`
    - `brinstïn (brinstïn) = arms`

Use of a topical noun such as _lërdi_ is similar to saying, "Let's talk about the book." English does not mark topics simply, but in a sentence like `Taiu biankas lërdi?` you are setting the topic of conversation by saying: `You see (that) book?`

## Politeness

In addition to topic marking, Hylian speakers often encode simple politeness into their speech by using a special suffix for nouns they respect, like, or revere. This suffix is written _ai_ for singular, or _nai_ for plural nouns, and it follows the standard nominal suffixes. However, elision often leads to it being pronounced and interpreted as an additional _i_ suffix, such that it is easy to confuse topicality and politeness.

This is most visible in cases such as `vina minazi` and `vina minazini` in which the noun may be pronounced with a final _i_ or _ai_ sound, and is strongly demonstrated in the words _batai_, _ohai_, and _sajanai_, which are formal salutations and valedictions.
