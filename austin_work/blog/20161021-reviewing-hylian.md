In February 2016, I took on the task of putting up a mirror of Kasuto.net's [Hylian Language Institute](http://kasuto.net/language.php?main=language/language.html), with the blessing of the original creator. My goal, however, goes beyond just mirroring his site -- I plan to expand upon the language in a way he has not done in years. Indeed, he primarily maintains his website for legacy reasons, and for the community in his forum.

So the first task I had before me was gathering all of the data on the language. This was easy enough -- it's only a few handfuls of data on the official HLI section of the site. But there are several issues to be considered:

1. The dictionary presented on the site is not a _full_ dictionary. Kasuto uses words in his language samples throughout the HLI that are not recorded on his own dictionary, but which are, nonetheless, given valid glosses.
2. The language is inconsistent with his own rules -- certain words have -i forms which he never fully explains, and the consistency of his particle use is more than a little bit lacking.
3.  The whole site runs off of a Windows-1252 encoding, while modern websites use UTF-8 as their baseline encoding. In addition to this, the fonts provided by Kasuto use several inelegant hacks to make typing complex Hylian easier -- but much harder to read if you are lacking the appropriate font.

These three problems each require their own solutions, which I will be sharing more details of in the coming weeks, but even six months in, I am finding inconsistencies in the otherwise regular Hylian language, or words missing from the official dictionary. It is my hope to complete the _Primer to Modern Hylian_ presented by the _New Gaea Entertainment and the Hylian Language Institute_ before the end of 2016, but this is at its core a side project.

Here, however, is a brief outline of my goals:

### The Grammar \& Lessons

_Primer to Modern Hylian_ is the name of the grammar and official dictionary of Kasuto's Hylian Language. This is an original compilation of the HLI into both web pages on this site, and an e-book which will be available from this site, for offline reading and review. The _Primer_ is the ultimate product of this review and compilation, but it cannot be fully completed without the other two goals being completed.

A short-form _Handbook_ will be available at an earlier date, possibly in the second half of November, which contains only the simple grammar description of the language without any dictionary or special fonts.

### The Dictionary

Every word from the HLI and Vinculum Community will be included in a new dictionary, including a credit to the creator of the word wherever possible. In addition to this, I am analyzing the words and texts against the six new latters Kasuto added on the Vinculum, but never updated the HLI to utilize. Credits will be given based on Vinculum usernames as of February 2016, when I compiled all of the data. This will also include never-before-seen extrapolations I have noted in my review and compilation work.

The dictionary will be available online as static pages, or as a PDF download, from this website as soon as it is completed.

### The Fonts

Kasuto made an excellent font, but it is one that is riddled with hacks and shortcuts that were necessary at the time. I am rebuilding his original fonts with the six new characters that he added, but I am also creating a family of 3 new fonts as well as Windows and Mac compatible input methods for typing Hylian more easily.

- **Hylian Gothic** is a san serif font modeled on the metrics of [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo), which is itself modeled on the metrics of Arial. This means that at any give font size, Hylian Gothic will flow smoothly with text presented in Arial or Arimo, which are among the more widely used san serif fonts. At present, Hylian Gothic is partially complete, and can be seen in the pages of this website which use Hylian text. However, not all Hylian letters are implemented yet, so some words may look incorrect.

- **Hylian Print** is a serifed font modeled on the metrics of [Tinos](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos), which is itself modeled on the metrics of Times New Roman. This means that at any given font size, Hylian Print will flow smoothly with text presented in Tinos or Times New Roman. At present, Hylian Gothic is partially complete, with work still being put in to making certain the digraphs work properly.

- **Hylian Draft** is a handwriting styled font modeled on the metrics and line angles of [Architect's Daughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter), a clean handwriting style font. While this font is not going to be featured in the _Primer_ e-book, it will be one of the options for viewing online, and available for download and use in artwork.

In addition to the three new fonts, all of which are Unicode compatible, I am producing an input method with maps for macOS and Windows computers: Hylian Simple. While I don't want to give everything away, it will allow for the simplest input of Hylian text from transliterations, while allowing a few helpful features for users who may prefer the original Kasuto-style input.

In order, the priority for these projects is actually:

1. **Dictionary**
2. **Fonts**
3. **Primer to Modern Hylian**
