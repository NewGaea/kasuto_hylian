# Temporary Holding List for _Hylian Community Wordlist (Suggest New Words)_

This document is a list of words, unfiltered for quality, from the [[archival/austin_work/Hylian Community Wordlist.txt|archived “Hylian Word List”]] compiled by [[austin-springer|Austin]]. This list is compiled by [[jerin-of-calatia|Jerin]] in order to bridge between the long, discussion-laden Forum Thread and the relatively more concise lexicon listing.

EDIT (28-Aug-2023): We are now confident that all recorded words have been documented in [[lexicon_community]], which embeds:
+ [[lexicon-community-apocryphal]] (for words which were do not have canonical and unconflicted glosses, or which violate the rules of grammar established by [[kasuto|Kasuto]])
+ [[lexicon-community-loanwords]] (for words borrowed and grammaticalized from English)
+ [[lexicon-collocations]] for multi-word terms developed by the community.

Any words not in these files, or [[lexicon_kasuto]] are either oversights, or not canonical. As it has been our objective to not pick and choose words for this documentation based on quality, or to change them significantly, we hope that all members of the original forums will see themselves credited and respected.
