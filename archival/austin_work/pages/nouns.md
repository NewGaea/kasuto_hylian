# sonEn hilanan<br />Sonën Hilanan

A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. An important characteristic of Hylian nouns is that the vast majority of them follow a regular pattern. Unlike English, in which nouns can have almost any ending, Hylian nouns all have the same ending. Plurality is also indictated by a regular pattern. Below are the two noun endings.

- Singular Nouns
  - -e (-e)
  - All regular singular nouns have an -e ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -e can only be a singular noun and nothing else. Here are examples of singular nouns:
    - `lErde (lërde) = book`
    - `brinste (brinste) = arm`

- Plural Nouns
  - -En (-ën)
  - All regular plural nouns have an -ën ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -ën can only be a plural noun and nothing else. Here are examples of plural nouns:
    - `lErdEn (lërdën) = books`
    - `BrinstEn (brinstën) = arms`

## Gender

Many languages, such as Spanish and French, assign nouns a grammatical gender. For example, the Spanish word _lapíz_, which means "pencil," is masculine; while the word _fotografía_, which means "photograph," is feminine. If this makes no sense to you, then you're in good company: only about half of all languages on Earth use such a system in the broadest sense. In some of these languages, grammatical gender is assigned to all words, even inanimate objects. However, in English, words have no grammatical gender. They only have a natural gender, i.e. "woman" is feminine, and "man" is masculine. Hylian also uses natural gender for words. It has an invariable definite article which does not change with gender. There are gender neutral words, as well as gender specific words, as in English. There is a regular way of turning a gender neutral word into a gender specific word. Here are some examples:

- `lErde	(lërde)	> book` (Gender neutral)
- `piante	(piante)	> parent` (Gender neutral)
- `pi&amp;ntile	(piántile) > father` (masculine)
- `pi&amp;ntine	(piántine) > mother` (feminine)

### Forming Gender-Specific Words

Forming a gender-specific noun conforms to a regular pattern. It involves taking the word stem and adding a suffix. When a gender suffix is added to the word, please note that an accent mark is added to preserve the stress of the original word. Here is an example using _dege_, which means "deity" or "god".

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only nouns can take a gender-specific subject, adjectives don't. When using an adjective to describe a gender-specific noun, the adjective only has to agree in number.

- **Neutral Word: Stem + Suffix + e = New Word**
  - `dege: deg + -il + e = dëgile`
  - `dege: deg + -in + e = dëgine`

- **Original Word: Definition \> New Word: Definition**
  - `dege: Deity (neutral) > dëgile: god (masculine)`
  - `dege: Deity (neutral) > dëgine: goddess (feminine)`
