# <span class="hylian_kas">bënkati kaz niatore dãa taz lañve hilana</span><br>Welcome to the Hylian Language Institute

I've seen a couple web sites out there that have so-called "Hylian dictionaries", but there are few entries and most of them are not very useful. This page is different. While other sites only have a few random entries, this one will develop a whole language. I am currently creating an alphabet, grammar rules, and a dictionary. I intend to create a working, speakable language. Please feel free to submit words and phrases, but I will correct them to follow the grammar rules.

**[Table of Contents](archival/austin_work/pages/toc)**

Note: This site is an official mirror. In theory, the current official version of this site can be found on [kasuto.net](http://kasuto.net). This site is provided as a mirror for when kasuto.net is down. In most regards, the contents of the original site are preserved in as close to their original form as possible while maintaining the look of the host site. All changes made will be reasonable and minor, intending only to reflect the slightly different nature of this mirror (ie: _fontën hilanan_ for "Hylian Fonts" instead of the original _fonte hilane_). For this mirror, all of the text has been updated to use Unicode, and all of the digraphs are mapped to use diacritics.

Note 2: This mirror is a work in progress. When finished it will use custom fonts to display Hylian text -- in the meantime, [custom transcriptions](standards/orthography/springer-font) [of Hylian](standards/orthography/springer-roman) will be used.

_Note 3: This mirror is now an archive. The HLS is preserving this archive for the sake of documentation._
