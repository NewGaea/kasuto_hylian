# <span class="hylian_kas">bënkati kaz niatore daia taz langve hilana</span><br>Welcome to the Hylian Language Institute

I've seen a couple web sites out there that have so-called "Hylian dictionaries", but there are few entries and most of them are not very useful. This page is different. While other sites only have a few random entries, this one will develop a whole language. I am currently creating an alphabet, grammar rules, and a dictionary. I intend to create a working, speakable language. Please feel free to submit words and phrases, but I will correct them to follow the grammar rules.

_Note: This site is an official mirror. In theory, the current version of this site can be found on kasuto.net. This site is provided as a mirror for when kasuto.net is down. In most regards, the contents of the original site are preserved in as close to their original form as possible while maintaining the look of the host site. All changes made will be reasonable and minor, intending only to reflect the slightly different nature of this mirror (ie: fontën hilanan for "Hylian Fonts" instead of the original fonte hilane). For this mirror, all of the text has been updated to use Unicode, and all of the digraphs are mapped to use diacritics._

_Note 2: This mirror is a work in progress. When finished it will use custom fonts to display Hylian text -- in the meantime, a non-standard transcription of Hylian will be used._

_Note 3: This mirror is now an archive. The HLS is preserving this archive for the sake of documentation._
