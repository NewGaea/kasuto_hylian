**Hylian Fonts**

_Do you like the Hylian alphabet presented here? Would you like to see a font for it, that you can install on your own computer? This, friends, is your lucky day: Kasuto and I have gone to the trouble of not only creating a TrueType font, but a whole selection of them for different uses. Now you can see, and write, Hylian on any site on the whole internet (though proper Hylian may be hard to find except on a few specific sites, like the Home of Hylian, [kasuto.net](kasuto.net). and here on the official mirror.)_

If for any reason, the links below do not work properly, please email `austin [at] newgaea [dot] net` with the subject "Hylian Font" and I will do my best to email you any of the Hylian fonts available through this site. This site also uses all of the fonts as web-fonts, so no download is necessary to see Hylian text on this site.

_Note: The fonts are not currently ready for download. We apologize for the inconvenience, and are hoping to complete the fonts soon._
