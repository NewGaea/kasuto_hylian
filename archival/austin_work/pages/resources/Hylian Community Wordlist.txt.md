I like **mámale** better because it's shorter, and it's got the accent mark, which would make it an exception to the "rule" of no accent marks (save the _ë_) in numbers. Exceptions are good.

I don't know how, but I instantly thought that instead of words, there should be a prefix to indicate size (not suffixes, because those indicate parts of speech). I thought of "**ma**" for "big" and "**dën**" for "small." Therefore, a tunic would be "**masoke**," or literally, "big shirt." (A baby-doll tee, on the other hand, would be a **dënsoke**.)

> Also, the more you say the prefix, the more you exaggerate the size. Like **mamamasoke** would be a REALLY big shirt. On top of that, the size is relative. Little Link's tunic would still be called a **masoke**, because it's a big shirt to him, but if Adult Link were to try and squeeze his way into clothes he wore seven years ago, his head would get stuck inside the **dënsoke**.

> This is where I got my inspiration. "**Dege**" is Hylian for "deity." We change "**dege**" to "**dégine**" for "goddess" and to "**dégile**" for "god." We have "**kímino•i**" for "little girl" and "**kímilo•i**" for "little boy." Obviously, the N and the L are for girls and boys, respectively. I thought, why not make the N and L prefixes, too? Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "**nusheoke**" for "girls' underclothes" and "**lusheoke**" for "boys' underclothes." "**Usheoke**" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "**dënnusheoke**" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::
>
> Of course, there are two SMALL problems with what I've done.... One: the double n in "**dënnusheoke**." Every letter in Hylian is supposed to be pronounced. How do you pronounce two Ns in a row? Two: the N and L prefixes only work for nouns that start with a vowel. What about the ones that start in consonants? I was thinking an apostrophe might work, but then again, it might not. "**N'kamoke**" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

Similarly, **masófile** would not indicate one's elder grandfather, but rather, someone older THAN one's grandfather, who should be one's grandfather's father, or one's great-grandfather.

OniGanon observes:

Link Æwondåslåmon rebuts:

> That's a very interesting language, emekthian, though I've always imagined the Kokiris speaking a much more beautiful language, without any uvular sound. :roll: I've never thought of making an own language for the Kokiris. In my fan fics they're speaking ancient Hylian, my own version of Hylian. :) The text below is written in my Hylian. In that language there are no uvular sounds, only beautiful sounds (might be because I only like beautiful sounds and don't wanna make a language that elves would think of as distasteful). :) But, you've done a great job.

emekthian rebuts:

Yeah, I know I'm weird. I'm speaking uvular r's myself. :mrgreen: Anyways, when we see the nature they live in, I don't think uvular sounds in their language would be likely :roll: , but it's your language.

"_Dën'_" would be used as the prefix if the next word started with a vowel, and "_dëna_" if it started with a consonant, or if there were another prefix. I was thinking that since I mentioned N and L, I could use that for gender itself. Simply, "**ne**" and "**na**" for "female" and "**le**" and "**la**" for male ("female" and "male" can be either a noun or an adjective, depending on usage; mostly adjectives). With that done, the underwear problem is solved. "_Dënusheokine_" ceases to exist because the "in" at the end implies the noun is a sentient being, and underwear most certainly is not.

> Similarly to "_dën'-_" and "_dëna-_", "**na**" and "**la**" would be apostrophized (is that a word? I can't find a dictionary that has a verb "to apostrophe") if the word it was describing started with a vowel. When used in conjunction, "small" would be "_dëna-_", because both "**na**" and "**la**" start with consonants, so good thing for that; there won't be apostrophes all over the place. "Lingerie," then, becomes "**Dënan'usheoke**." Man-thongs (ew?), "**dënal'usheoke**." "_Ma_" would not have this rule. That's what we call irregular, folks.

BBB gratefully nods:

> However I do think the words:

Venus, Queen of Faeries grins:

> Well, they are... their spellings just need to be modified a teeny bit to fit Kasuto's grammar rules. I only copied things verbatim; I didn't touch anything (though I added **batyahe** as a word for "valley." I think that sounds pretty cool. Think you could use it, OniGanon?).

The upside of this is that you can get to it -- all the words at once -- whenever you want. The downside of this is that the Hylian font will not be included (since you can only have one style of text in a .txt file), and the parts of speech will not be italicized. If you want the .doc file that I'm writing, which will include all of that, you can PM me when I'm finished. I'll also be making a version that includes our suggestions. However, I won't be uploading that. I'll be updating it constantly to keep up with the changes that we make in this thread, so if you'd like that at any time, you can PM me for that, too.

-----

Venus, Queen of Faeries reflects:

> We have shadow and darkness already.... unless you mean _lune_ to be used ONLY as the element (and _nasuna_ NEVER to be used for the element), not like "I don't have a shadow cuz the sun went behind a cloud." But then we'd have to get special words for the other five elements, too. That could be interesting, actually.

_Austin Springer's Aside: I believe this proposal flies in the face of Kasuto's description of the language. While I do not object to including it as part of the future or past development of Hylian, the inclusing of nominative and objective forms defies Kauto's own words about pronouns:_

> Unlike in English, Hylian pronouns do not have different forms depending on their function in a sentence. Particles like _ab_ and _ank_ tell if a pronoun is used as a subject or object.

_It is for this reason that the objective forms of pronouns will be included only as an addendum to the Primer and Dictionary. I mean no offense to you, QBri, but this proposal does not fit with the state of Hylian as Kasuto describes it._

Venus, Queen of Faeries welcomes:

> I'm not saying you're right, and I'm not saying you're wrong, but maybe using the direct object particle before the pronoun like this is just one of those things about Hylian that's weird to foreigners. Personally, I accept a lot of that. Makes it more challenging and more fun, like it's really a real language. ^_^
>
> Okay, now one quick (and small, painless) correction: "me" (in English) is still a pronoun, so its Hylian equivalent would have to end in -u. Same for you (your objective form already does, but I'm just pointing it out anyway), us and you all.

Venus, Queen of Faeries wonders:

> Merriam Webster Online (what I use to double check parts of speech) says here and there are adverbs. o_o I don't understand that, because you'd think "here" would take the place of "this place" and "there" would take the place of "that place", but maybe since "this" and "that" are adjectives, "here" and "there" MUST be adverbs. \@\_\@ Yay English. I really need to take some linguistics courses. What about a word for "way over there?" Can we have one of those? I like those.
>
> I don't understand the **toka**/**toa**/**boka** bit. What's with "all **toke**" "some **toe**" and "none **boke**"? Sorry.... But, if **toka** means all, and **toa** means some (**boka** means none, then?), everyone (everybody) would be all people, or _tokan hitën_. BUT, it's a pronoun, so it's got to end in _-u_, and _tokan hitënu_ is kinda long, so if anyone's got an idea, great. Same for no one (nobody). Someone is different, though.
>
> I could swear we already had a word for "also".... but I agree with your note on prepositions. Let's just use _ank_ for everything.

-----

QBri concurs:

> That's really weird. The way I see it, Hylian is its own language, alien to our world's languages. So I think that we can count "here" and "there" as adjectives. But if you think it's better to have them as adverbs then we can do that. Either way is fine with me really.

> In english, our words "this" and "that" work both as pronouns (i.e.- this is the best.) and as adjectives (this car is big.), but in Hylian, Kasuto created two separate pairs: _za_ and _zata_ are adjectives (thus for plurals they must have -n added to the end.) And _zu_ and _zatu_ are pronouns. For _zu_ and _zatu_ you must add an -i before the "u" to make them plural (i.e- _ziu_ - these, _zatiu_ - those)

> Take a look:
>
> - `Za tinske tairas torima.` `This work is finished.` (note that the adjective form of "this" is used to describe the work. And notice that "finished" is technically an adjective in this context and thus the verb _torimag_ becomes the adjective _torima_. In English however, past tense verbs can act as adjectives so this seems odd to us. But it makes sense if you think about it. *end note*
>   - _Austin Springer's Aside: Kasuto outlines that the participle (the descriptive sense mentioned here) does not exist in Hylian. In addition to the above, the analysis of the sentence is flawed: the sentence should read_ `Zu tinske shiu torimant.` `This work (is) finished.` _In this case, the word "zu" is a demonstrative pronoun, not an adjective._
>
> - `Zu tairas vinazwa.` `This is best/better.` (This uses the pronoun "this" which takes the form of the subject. Remember that the pronoun forms can also be used as objective forms.) *side note - I'm assuming that the suffix _-zwa_ is being accepted as the superlative/comparitive suffix. Thus it can be added like so.

Venus, Queen of Faeries agrees:

> Those are good suggestions, and I won't hesitate to add them once we figure out what to make them end in. (For those of you just joining us,) Hylian's a grammar-coded language, so we can't have prepositions like jade ending in E when singular nouns end in E. The other problem is that Hylian prepositions don't have a set ending.

Venus, Queen of Faeries ponders:

> I was thinking that, because languages change over time, and often-used words don't really adhere to rules. But now it seems like there are getting to be too many that aren't applying to any rule. There should be at least a FEW that follow it, shouldn't there?

-----

QBri observes:

> The way I see it, adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all follow a regular pattern (-a for adjectives, -e for nouns, -ag for verbs, -ok for adverbs) so that leaves conjunctions and prepositions with no standard (which is what Kasuto seems to have done intentionally, considering **the conjunctions and prepositions he's created don't follow any pattern**) so I think we should just go with what we know. And what we do know is that Kasuto left no specific instructions for conjunctions or prepositions. Which is personally fine with me, since there's a lot less conjunctions and prepositions than any of the other categories. So it'll be easy to learn the conjunctions and prepositions, without having to rely on a certain system.

In Kasuto's alphabet section it says it's pronounced like an English "r," but I've always trilled/rolled the Hylian R's because I always think a trilled R sounds better than an english R. But I just wanted to know how you guys pronounced them? (If you all are actually weird enough to talk to yourselves in Hylian.)

Both of them can't mean "how" so I figured the _jano_ to be "how" and _tano_ to be "how many," since the response you would give to "_edas ta•iu tano_" would be a number.

_Austin Springer's Aside: Some of these words may not fit into Hylian -- **aute** and **kiane** are useful for those who want to use Hylian in everyday modern life, but this is not the stated purpose of the language. These words will likely be ignored, or footnoted, in the actual wordlist_

> EDIT: QBri, I've added most of your words to the dictionary. And it took me a while, whew! Most of them went off without a hitch, but I have a couple of questions about some:
>
> 1. There are some words whose parts of speech don't match their English counterparts (everyone, sometime, indeed, etc.). In English, they're all either adverbs or pronouns, but you've turned them into regular nouns (with the exception of jha and vor, I believe). I'm just wondering if that was on purpose, cuz we discussed that before, or if they should be changed.
>
> 2. "dega". You mentioned this word once, but never gave it a meaning. Context clues tell me it may mean "illegal", but I'm not sure.
>
> 3. "haiag", "aute", "koiag". Not sure if there are supposed to be diphthongs here, so if you'd clarify, I'd appreciate it.
>
> 4. I think it was you -- if not, then this goes out to the creator -- who came up with the word "shgote" for work. Kasuto's already made up tïnske (and I suppose tïnskag would follow as the verb), so.
>
> 5. via vs. ablat. You've got them both meaning "by way of." Do you have a preferred one? Via is the only one in the dictionary I've got now.
>
> Thanks a lot.

-----

QBri nods:

> Okay, sorry, you're right I need to clear up some of these:

> 1. A problem in english is that words can often be used as nouns or as adjectives. (i.e. - "all" is a great example. ex. - get all that you can (noun) vs. we all are... (adj. form). Take a quick look:
>    1. **Toka** - all (solely an adjective) **Toke** - everything/all (noun)
>    1. **Tokakrone** - Forever (noun) vs. Tokakrona - Always (adjective)
>
> The thing is, Hylian words don't quite match up to their english counterparts, so their english translations can be the same for different words. If you tell me the context of the word I used that you think is flawed I'll explain it better. But for now this is all I can tell you.
>
> As for **jha** and **vor**, **vor** can be used as a conjunction. And as for **jha**, well, sounds (or in this case "interjections") don't always have to follow a strict pattern, since a lot of interjections come from sounds that people cry out under circumstances, so **jha** could just be irregular.
>
> 2. Give me the context of the word, but I'm pretty sure it's meant to be an adjective form of "dege" which would mean it means "godly" or "divine"
> 3. Yes there is supposed to be diphthongs, I just don't know what keys to press to mark it. But they are supposed to have diphthongs. I don't really think they need to be marked, since _ai_ and _au_ are already marked in the tutorial as always being one complete sound.
> 4.) You're right, _tinske_ is the word I should've used. Scrap the _shgote_ word.
> 5.) Keep _via_. I probably wasn't thinking when I made _ablat_ and accidentally added it. But you're right keep via.
>
> Okay, if there's nothing else I'll post later.

> _Austin Springer's Aside: This does sound like a fair call, especially since Kasuto's dictionary treats the diphthongs as unique letters.

Venus, Queen of Faeries is struck by inspiration:

> OniGanon wrote:
> > Directions (up, down, left, right, forward, back, compass points)
>
> More inspiration yesterday. I was thinking that since there are eight elements in the Zelda worlds (Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, Earth and Wind/Air), that each should represent a compass point. Something like when the InuYasha crew was looking for Naraku and they were told something about the direction of the ox and tiger (which is northwest, apparently), if you've seen that particular storyarc.
>
> Anyway. So the elements should each represent one of the eight compass points. But which would go where? I figure the opposites should be opposite each other: Light and Shadow, Fire and Water, Earth and Air. That leaves Forest and Spirit, which aren't opposites per se, but if you figure that a forest is full of life, and a spirit sort of represents the afterlife, then it kind of works.
>
> So now we've got opposites, but where to put them all? I thought that perhaps Light should go in the east, as that's where the sun rises. Shadow would then be west, and that makes sense because by the time the sun's in the west, it's getting dark out. Earth should be on the bottom (south), closest to the earth, and that would make Wind/Air up top (north), which is closest to the sky.
>
> Next, I thought Fire should go in the southwest, between Earth and Shadow, because fires are ground-based and cause death. Water, then, would be in the northeast, between Air and Light because rain comes from the sky and gives life (light). That leaves Forest in the southeast, between Earth and Light, because a forest is an earthy thing, and... life (light), so yeah. Spirit, death and cuz they ascend to heaven or whatever. Either way, this should sum it all up:

_Austin Springer's Note: I support this idea entirely. senses of words are a major deal that is often overlooked in early conlanging. This will be a good demonstration of flexibility in Hylian._

Venus, Queen of Faeries explains:

> Accents are really easy.... I'm sure that I posted the list of how to do them somewhere in this thread. With respect to the accents, though, they're a reflection of how YOU would pronounce the words. So, I ask you: heVONpita or hevonPIta? (and so on.)
>
> There's a word for face... either aikwe and andwe. Something like that. One means face and the other means finger. I've gotten my own words confused. I'll add 'mask' to the list, and also merkle.

> We're comin' up on the big five-oh-oh, everyone! Thanks to all who have participated for your help! Together we can make this project take off again, and I hope to hear more from all of you -- and new people too -- in the next five hundred. ^_^!!!

> **Tsukae** - operator/user/wielder
> Tote-sate-ute-kate-akte-tote-ete

>
> And finally...
> Word #503
> **Mevine**- master of a skill
> Mate-ete-vete-ite-note-ete
> Derived from "mevyn" (sp?)
> This is also capable of being compounded with either of the two above words to denote mastery of a certain art or stand alone as a generic term for a master in the same sense. (i.e. this does NOT mean master in the sense of a commander.)

How's that sound? I also have a suggestion: **vomevine**, for a novice or beginner. ^_^

> Also, Auric, I've noticed that you've got a "ts" combo going on in there. "Ts" was actually planned to be its own letter (see the old thread, here. Actually, I'm glad to have linked to that; now it won't take me ages to find it again). I think, the same way that we use "ch" as one letter, that we'll have to do the same for "ts". Let me know what you think, before I add that one, and also check out the other planned letters, too. Note: the thread was created over three years ago, but the letters were never added -- officially -- to the language or the font.

Auric concedes:

Sage of Silence asks:

> I'll admit, I'm lazy and don't want to look in 13 pages of posts, but I was wondering, is there a Hylian word for "until" yet? Right now, I'm using _az_, for "to the", but until would suit the phrase much better. It's for a fanfic I'm working on (and is in the post your own fanfic section, if you'd like to get a better idea on how until/to the is being used). I don't know enough about how the language is constructed to suggest a word myself. If there is one, could someone let me know?

-----

Venus, Queen of Faeries answers:

> Until = **jade**

Dagger341 offers:

> By the way, Dagger341, I'm so sorry. D: Two of those words have already been thought up, BUT, we'll hold onto **venag** (exisiting word: _ipag_) and **martag** (existing word: _reaketag_) for something else. If you do mean the third for measuring time, we'll keep it, but I wanna make sure, so I haven't added it to the list yet.

Dagger341 apologizes:
