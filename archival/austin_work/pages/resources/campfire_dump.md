# Campfire Project Dump

At one point, [[austin-springer|Austin]] attempted to transfer this documentation into the language documentation feature of Campfire Pro. This attempt included some new coinages, and some novel interpretations of procedural handling of certain things, and is being preserved here as of 2023-Dec-01.
## Verb Tenses

Verbs (_wirtën_) in Hylian occur in one of the **past**, the **present**, or the **future**, and all of these tenses incorporate if the verb is _perfect,_ or *completed,* versus not.
##### Table V.1 - Verb Tenses  
| **\*tair** | **Simple** | **Perfect** |
|:----|:------:|:-------:|
| **Past** | _taires_ | _tairënt_ |
| **Present** | _tairas_ | _tairant_ |
| **Future** | _tairos_ | _tairont_ |
| **Infinitive** | _tairag_ | N/A |
| **Imperative** | _tairans_ | N/A |

+ **Simple Past:** The simple past (_krone depotroshe_) is any event that is behind the time-reference of the statement being made.
	+ _taiu taires_ => _you were, you used to be_
+ **Past Perfect:** The past perfect (_krone depotroshe daia kimare_) is used to refer to events that have been completed at the time-reference of the statement.
	+ _bagu lërdënt_ => _I finished reading_
+ **Simple Present:** The simple present (_krone akantroshe_) refers to any action which is going on at roughly the time-reference of the statement being made.
	+ _ëru tairas_ => _I am, I exist_
+ **Present Perfect:** The present perfect (_krone akantroshe daia kimare_) refers to actions which have _just_ been completed at the time-reference of the statement being made.
	+ _bagu koemant_ => _I just ate_
+ **Simple Future:** The simple future (_krone baakantroshe_) refers to any action which has not yet happened, but will, or may, happen in the future.
	+ _sëru jhatos_ => _she will speak_
+ **Future Perfect:** The future perfect _(krone baakantroshe daia kimare)_ is a rare construction, and in Hylian refers to actions which are intended, planned, or prophesied to occur. The future perfect appears often in prophecies and in religious praxis to make promises or oaths to deities.
	+ _bagu torimont ab tinske_ => _I promise to finish my work, I swear to complete my task_
+ **Infinitive Voice:** The infinitive voice is used to refer to a verb as part of a phrase in which it is not the inflected verb, or in a phrase where it has no subject or object.
	+ _bagu tairas jhatag_ => _I am speaking_
+ **Imperative Voice:** The imperative voice isused to create a command or direction out of a verb.
+ **Gerunds in Hylian:** In Hylian, the gerund is formed by simply declining the verb stem as a noun.
	+ _bagusu jhate_ => _my speech_
### Verbal Moods & Adjuncts

In addition to the standard conjugations, a number of auxiliary words may be added before a verb to modify its meaning. These adjuncts do not conjugate for tense, instead they assume the same tense as the verb they are modifying.
#### **shi**
When placed before a verb, _shi_ indicates that the action is ongoing at the time reference of the statement. It is equivalent to the english use of "to be" or "continue to." This adjunct can be used with any tense.

+ _bagu shi lërdas_ => _I am reading, I continue to read_
#### **sho**
When placed before a verb, _sho_ indicates incompletion or discontinuity with the past. It is equivalent to the English use of "used to" or "was" with the explicit condition that the action is not complete. This adjunct is only compatible with the simple past.

+ _bagu sho lërdes_ => _I was reading, I used to read (but didn't finish)_
#### **shai**
When placed before a verb, _shai_ indicates the subjunctive mood, or a verb that is in some way unreal or indirect. In particular, the subjunctive encompasses states of unreality such as: wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred. This adjunct occurs more often in subordinate clauses than main clauses. This adjunct is compatible only with the simple present and present perfect tenses.

+ _bagu shai jhatant "lërdans ab taz lërde"_ => _I might say, "read the book."_
#### **she**
When placed before a verb, _she_ indicates the imperative mood. This adjunct creates a less forceful command than the _imperative tense_ defined above, which is a subjunctive equivalent to the English use of "should" or "ought." This adjunct is compatible with both the _simple present_ and _present perfect_ tenses, though like all imperatives it implies performing a task to completion.

+ _Zelda she jhatant ab taiu ank za trofashe_ => _Zelda ought to have told you about the Triforce (just now)_
#### **sha**
When placed before a verb, _sha_ indicates the super-imperative mood, or an obligation of necessity. This is more forceful than the adjunct _she_, and yet is still slightly less forceful than a direct command in the _imperative tense_. While this adjunct is most commonly used with the _simple present_ and _present perfect_, it is compatible with all verb forms except the infinitive. It is most forceful when used with the imperative tense.

+ _taiu sha lërdas ab za lërde_ => _you must read this book, you shall read this book_  
#### **shu**
When placed before a verb, _shu_ indicates the conditional ability mood, or that the action is possible, but not certain. Consider the sentence _"bagu jhatas ab hilana,"_ meaning, _"I (can) speak Hylian."_ This sentence offers certainty about the act of speaking Hylian.

If we change the sentence to _"bagu shu jhatas ab hilana,"_ we would introduce uncertainty, and the translation might be close to, _"I could speak Hylian."_ This adjunct specifically creates the sense that while one has the ability, it may be poor or uncertain. A more defined statement might include a relative clause: _"bagu shu jhatas ab hilana at lintes,"_ would translate as _"I could speak Hylian if (I) learned (how)."_ This adjunct is typically used with the two _present_ tenses, but if a following clause is used, the verb of that clause will usually be in a _past_ tense.
#### **shiu**
When placed before a verb, _shiu_ indicates the passive voice, or that the Subject of the statement is actually the patient or object of the verb, and the Object of the sentence is actually the agent. While Hylian does not support full passivization, it can be used to create indefinite constructions.

+ _hilana shiu jhatas_ => _We speak Hylian, Hylian is spoken here_
#### **shite**
When placed before a verb, _shite_ indicates the reflexive, or the situation in which the subject and object, or agent and patient, of a statement are identical.

+ _Zelda_ _shite jhatas_ => _Zelda speaks to herself_  
### **naz**
When placed before a verb, _naz_ indicates the negative mood, or a situation in which the verb does not occur.

+ _Link naz tairas_ => _Link does not speak_

## Pronouns

### Personal Pronouns

Pronouns pattern as nouns because they substitute for noun phrases.

Personal pronouns end with _-u_ for singular and plural, though plural pronouns are less regularly derived than other classes of words.

##### Table P.1 - Pronouns by Person, Gender, and Number  

| | **Singular** | **Plural** |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| **First Person** | _bagu_ | _nosu_ |
| **Second Person** | _taiu_ | _vosu_ |
| **Third Person, Neuter** | _ru_ | _iru_ |
| **Third Person, Masc.** | _ëru_ | _iëru_ |
| **Third Person, Fem.** | _sëru_ | _siëru_ |
| **Fourth Person, Indef.** | _riu_ | *_iriu_ |

The gendered plural forms of third person pronouns are rarely used unless a group consists entirely of members of the same gender.

The indefinite or fourth person pronoun allows communication about generic, abstract, or unknown referents.

Pronouns may take the genitive as if they were nouns, with the same _-su_ and _-sun_ suffixes applied.
### Impersonal Pronouns

Impersonal pronouns are pronouns which don't refer to people, and they include demonstratives and interrogative pronouns, such as who, where, what, when, why, and how.
##### Table P.2 - Pronouns by Role  
| | **Dem. Immediate** | **Dem. Proximate** | **Interrogative** |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Object, Sing.** | _za_<br>(this) | _zata_<br>(that) | _kono_<br>(what) |
| **Object, Pl.** | _zan<br>(these) | _zatan_<br>(those) | _konon_<br>(what[s]) |
| **Place, Sing.** | _*käna_<br>(here) | _*känta_<br>(there) | _*käno_<br>(where) |
| **Place, Pl.** | _*känan_<br>(here[s]) | _*käntan_<br>(there[s]) | _*käno_<br>(where[s]) |
| **Person, Sing.** | _*zaru_<br>(this person) | _*zataru_<br>(that person) | _*kózaro_<br>(who) |
| **Person, Pl.** | _*zarun_<br>(these people) | _*zatarun_<br>(those people) | _*kózaron_<br>(who, pl.) |
| **Time, Past** | _*akan_<br>(now) | _depoto_<br>(before) | _*këpoto_<br>(when, past) |
| **Time, Future** | _*akan_<br>(now) | _bado_<br>(after) | _*këbado_<br>(when, future) |
| **Quantity** | _*kako'a_<br>(this much) | _*känko'a_<br>(that much) | _*konto_<br>(how much) |
| **Manner** | _*mo'a_<br>(like this) | _*mo'ata_<br>(like that) | _*kiumo_<br>(how) |
| **Motivation** | _*taro_<br>(because of this) | _*tarota_<br>(because of that) | _*kutaro_<br>(why) |
#### **Object Pronouns**
Impersonal pronouns of objects are used to refer to inanimate and most abstract concepts. These are also the only impersonal pronouns originally provided by Kasuto, as noted by the * prefixing every other entry in this chart (except _depoto_ and _bado_).  
#### **Place Pronouns**
These impersonal demonstratives refer to places. Plural paces are used to refer to groups of places, for example _känan daia hirule_ => _these lands of Hyrule_.
#### **Person Pronouns**
While it is generally true that impersonal pronouns do not refer to people, these demonstratives allow you to refer to specific people you don't know, but who are present, or to groups of people. For example, _zatarun goërën_ => _those Gorons_. This is not to be confused with the personal pronouns _ru_ and _iru_, which stand in for a whole noun phrase about _they_ or _them_.

## Particles

Hylian uses particles to mark the _direct object_ and _indirect object_ of verbs. There is no particle to mark the subject.

### **ab**
The direct object, following the verbal phrase of a clause, is marked with the particle _ab_ to indicate the start of the direct object clause. The direct object is the noun being given, taken, or acted upon.

+ _bagu diares ab taz lërde_ => _I gave (away) the book_  
### **ank**
The indirect object, following the verbal phrase or direct object of a clause, is marked with the particle _ank_ to indicate the start of the indirect object clause. The indirect object is the recipient of an action involving a direct object.

+ _Zelda jhatent ab trofashe ank Link_ => _Zelda told Link all about the Triforce, Zelda spoke all about the Triforce to Link_

## Articles
Not to be confused with the _particles_ defined above to mark direct and indirect objects, _articles_ are used to encode information about a noun in speech, such as demonstratives or definiteness. Articles don't have an inherent part of speech, but generally link to a noun or pronoun.

### **taz**
The definite article, _taz_, goes before a noun which has been previously referenced, and is important.

+ _bagu lërdas ab taz lërde_ => _I read the book_
### **raz**
The indefinite article, _raz_, goes before a noun which is less salient or relevant, or is part of a group being specified.

+ _taiu lërdant ab raz lërde_ => _I read a book_
