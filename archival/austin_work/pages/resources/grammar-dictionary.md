# Hylian Dictionary - Grammar Markers

This file collects the official dictionary and wordlist used on Kasuto.net's Hylian Language Institute, as well as all community contributions, into a single list. Unlike the Complete version, this version collects _only_ grammar markers -- particles, articles, infixes, prefixes and suffixes.

## Format Rules

Unlike the complete list, this is an actual reference page on all of the grammar markers in the Hylian language.

Formatting to be used is thus:
* Hylian Font shall be in **strong format**
* Romanized column shall be (within a pair of parentheses)
* Category shall be in _emphasis format_
* Glosses shall be 1. enumerated in groups
* Usage Notes shall be 1. enumerated to match their respective gloss
* Sample texts and translations will be in individual `preformatted text blocks`
* Contributors of content shall be credited in (_emphasis format within parentheses_) after all other fields.

Where references to other words are made, the word should be given _emphasis formatting_ to show that it refers to the word as a word, not as a reference to what it means.

## Grammatical Suffixes

This section discusses only the grammar marking suffixes for words, sorted by word class.

### Nouns \& Pronouns

Nouns (_sonën_) are words referring to things which are considered real: persons, places, things, ideas. A noun may be a subject or object of a sentence. In Hylian, nouns inflect for number and topicality.

- **-e** (-e) is the singular nominal suffix. Any word which ends with -e is a noun referring to a singular or mass count object.

- **-ën** (-ën) is the plural nominal suffix. Any word which ends with -ën is a noun referring to a plural, but not mass count, object.

- **-i** (-i) is the singular topical suffix. Any word which ends with -i is a topic for discussion. This is primarily used only in speech or writing of dialogue.

- **-ïn** (-ïn) is the plural topical suffix. Any word which ends with -ïn is a plural topic for discussion. This is primarily used only in speech or writing of dialogue.

#### Polite Speech

It is common in speech to use topical forms of nouns, particularly for greetings and valedictions, but also for other expressions, such as titles or terms of endearment. While the base forms replace other nominal suffixes, the short forms follow a regular nominal or topical suffix.

- **-ai** (-ai) or **-i** is the salutative suffix. When added to the end of a word, it indicates that it is part of a greeting. Also used to show respect towards something, when used with words that are not normally used in greetings.

- **-nai** (-nai) or **-ni** is the valedictive suffix. When added to the end of a word, it indicates an intent or desire to depart. Also used to show disrespect towards something, when used with words that are not normally used in partings.

#### Pronouns

- **-u** (-u) is the standard pronoun indicator. Any word ending with -u is a pronoun, referring to a noun established earlier in the discourse.

#### Genitive

The genitive indicates ownership or membership: It indicates that one thing belongs to another. This can be possession of an object, as in "my book" or membership in something like "my church." In Hylian, there are two suffixes for this:

- **-su** (-su) indicates the superior genitive, or cases in which the marked subject to which is the superior (owner, leader, founder) in the genitive relationship.

- **-so** (-soi) indicates the inferior genitive, or cases in which the marked subject is the inferior (possession, member, child) in the genitive relationship.

These suffixes may be used in property or social situations, however social situations also allow several additional forms:

##### Social Genitives

There are also three levels of genitive used in social contexts which are not used in property contexts:

- **-aSi** (-shi) indicates the social superior genitive. It is used primarily as a post-suffix in terms of endearment used between older family members to younger, but sometimes also between a master and apprentice.
- **-aSoi** (-shoi) indicate the social neutral genitive. It is used primarily between peers and generational cohorts within a family or organization, but also among coworkers regardless of age or status, as a general sign of respect.
- **-oi** (-oi) indicates the social inferior genitive. It is used primarily by younger persons towards older, but is also used as a general sign of respect when dealing with unfamiliar people. This may be modified to **-loi** or **-noi** to indicate the gender of the person being addressed.

Although these social forms are primarily used by age, they can also indicate difference in class between speaker and addressee. They are often added as part of a title or honorific.

#### Proper Nouns

Proper nouns are very special: they do not always follow the same rules as other nouns. This is because proper nouns are not always words that are typically nouns. Here are some rules for forming a proper noun in Hylian:

1. Proper Nouns begin with the stem that best captures their meaning, dropping any vowels that normally occur at the end of the stem. For example: _din_, _far_, _nair_, _link_, or _zeld_.
2. The stem is composed into the class which reflects their meaning:
   1. In naming, -e indicates a _simple noun_, which is something that does or can physically exist in the word. _linke_, _zane_
   2. In naming, -u indicates an _abstract noun_, which does not exist in the physical world, rather than a pronoun. _nairu_, _kasu_
   3. In naming, -a indicates a _descriptive name_, which is one that is meant to either be an ideal to model, a vice to avoid, or a simple description. _dina_, _zelda_
   4. In naming, -o indicates an _active name_, or a name based on a verb or action. _miaro_
   5. A single name may combine any two of these suffixes, except for -e and -u. When combining elements, the last one in the above list should come first in the name. Use diphthongs where the letters create them (oa, au). _kapoe_, _epou_
3. They are given the proper name infix -r- (if they end with a sequence of vowels) or the appropriate suffix for their class:
   1. If the name represents a physical noun (e), such as _faroe_, it must end in _ra_, _re_, or _ro_.
   2. If the name represents an abstract noun (u), such as _nairu_, it must end in _na_, _ne_, or _no_.
   3. If the name represents an adjective (a), such as _dina_, it must end in _sa_, _se_, or _so_
   4. If the name represents an action (o, ans), such as _miarans_, it must end in _ta_, _te_, or _to_. The /t/ of this suffix replaces the imperative /s/.
   5. Of the above, /a/ names are seen as gender neutral and preferred for pet or animal names (_Linkera_, _Kapoera_, _Epouna_), /e/ is associated with female names (_Dinase_, _Farore_, _Nairune_), and /o/ is associated with male names (_Kasuto_, _Miaranto_, _Zaneto_).
4. An /i/ may be added to the end of a name to show respect, especially for elders or higher class persons.
5. Any other suffix may be added after the name.

### Descriptors: Adjectives \& Adverbs

Adjectives are words which describe _nouns_, while adverbs are words which described _verbs_. In short, an adjective is a word which answers one of the question words "Who, which, where or what kind?" An adverb, on the other hand, answers one of, "How, when or why?" In English, adverbs can be formed with the _-ly_ suffix on another class of word.

In Hylian, any root can become an adjective or adverb simply by using the proper suffix, however it is still important to remember that the number of an adjective must match the number of the noun which it describes:

- **-a** (-a) is the singular adjective suffix. Any word which ends with -a is an adjective describing a singular or mass count object.

- **-an** (-a) is the plural adjective suffix. Any word which ends with -a is an adjective describing a plural, but not mass count, object.

- **-ok** (-ok) is the adverbial suffix. Any word which ends with -ok is an adjective describing a verb or action.

### Verbs

Verbs are those words which make the world move -- or at least those words we use to refer to movement and action, or even to inaction. Verbs conjugate for tense and mood, with three tenses and four moods.

#### The Simple Mood

The Simple Mood is the standard form of a verb with no conjugation applied for any other mood. The simple mood only inflects for the three tenses: past, present, and future.

- **-as** (-as) is the suffix for the simple present tense. This refers to actions that are current, whether they are habitual, in progress, or currently interrupted. For example, "I read books."
- **-es** (-es) is the suffix for the simple past tense. This refers to actions that happened in the past. For example, "I read books when I was younger."
- **-os** (-os) is the suffix for the simple future tense. This refers to actions that may or will happen in the future. For example, "I will read the new book by Kasuto."

#### The Perfect Mood

The perfect mood refers to actions as discrete, completed events. A perfect is not an act which is in progress or interrupted, it is one which is complete at the given point in time. Note that even a future action can be perfect in this sense -- it simply means that at the time referred to, the action will be completed.

- **-ant** (-ant) is the suffix for the present perfect tense. This refers to actions which are currently finished. For example, "I built the house."
- **-ënt** (-ënt) is the suffix for the past perfect tense. This refers to actions which were completed at some point in the past. For example, "I built the house last year."
- **-ont** (-ont) is the suffix for the future perfect tense. This refers to actions which will be completed at a particular point in the future. For example, "By next year, I will have built the house."

#### The Infinitive Mood

The infinitive mood is the dictionary form for all verbs in Hylian. While Kasuto only presents a single infinitive, the infinitive can conceivably be conjugated with the same patterns as the other tenses, though English does not typically combine time and infinitive marking.

**-ag** (-ag) is the suffix for the (present) infinitive. This is equivalent to the English construction of "to verb," and suggests a present time.
**-ëg** (-ëg) would suggest a past infinitive, or the construction "to have verbed" in English, as in "'Tis better to have loved..." It is worth noting that this is an assumption, not a part of Kasuto's official grammar.
**-og** (-og) would suggest a future infinitive, which could be used as a form of intentional, which might be similar to "want to verb" in English. It is worth noting that this is an assumption, not a part of Kasuto's official grammar.

As an additional addendum to the infinitive, the _gerund_ form of a verb, that form which allows a verb to serve as a noun, becoming the subject or object of a sentence, can be formed by adding a nominal suffix (-e, -ën, -i, -ïn) after the infinitive suffix. This is an addendum, but a sensible one.

#### Verbal Adjuncts

Although these are not grammatical affixes, they are words which change the meaning of a verb by conveying an additional layer of meaning about mood or state. Adjuncts are always placed immediately before the verb they modify, and they can look like other parts of speech. While I intend to modify the rules on verbal adjuncts to make them more regular, the official adjuncts are:

- **Si** (shi) is the progressive adjunct. It forms a verb which is currently in progress.
- **So** (shoi) is the imperfect adjunct. It forms a verb which is neither in progress nor completed, or which was true in the past but is no longer true. This adjunct can apply only to _simple past_ tense.
- **Sai** (shai) is the subjunctive adjunct. It indicates intent without commitment, uncertainty of intent, or indefinite command (as in a request which may be turned down). This adjunct can only apply to _present_ tenses, though it can apply to any mood.
- **Soi** (shoi) is the conditional adjunct. It indicates intent without commitment, due to uncertainty or negative certainty of preconditions. This adjunct can only apply to _present_ tenses, though it can apply to any mood.
- **Se** (she) is the imperative adjunct. It indicates strong suggestions or weak commands, without condition or uncertainty. It is the equivalent to use of "should" or "ought" in English. This adjunct can be used with the _simple present_ or _present perfect_ tenses.
- **Sa** (sha) is the super-imperative adjunct. It indicates very strong suggestions, rules or rulings, or laws. It is the equivalent to the use of "ought" or "shall" in English. This adjunct can be used with the _simple present_ or _present perfect_ tenses.
- **Su** (shu) is the conditional ability adjunct. It indicates the potential to perform an action with uncertainty or negative certainty of preconditions. While related to _panktag_ (to be able to do), this is distinct in that it suggests conditions on the ability.
- **Siu** (shiu) is the passive adjunct. Because participles do not exist in Hylian, a sentence in the _passive voice_ is difficult to construct without use of this adjunct. This turns the direct object of the verb into the subject of the sentence, but requires that no subject be provided.
- **Site** (shite) is the reflexive adjunct. This causes the subject of the sentence to become the direct object of the verb as well, without repeating the subject.
- **naz** (naz) is the negative adjunct. This adjunct precedes all others, and creates the negative mood of the verb. using the infinitive, this is equivalent to "not to verb" or "to not verb" depending on how you feel about splitting infinitives in English.

> Part of the goal of the _Primer_ is to improve the consistency of the Hylian language, and as noted above, that will include a review of verbal adjuncts to make them a part of speech that aligns with the other parts of speech in utility and aesthetic.

#### The Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is the mood used to give commands and orders. While Kasuto only presents a single imperative, this mood can conceivably be conjugated with the same patterns as the other tenses, though English does not typically combine time and imperative marking.

- **-ans** (-ans) is the suffix for the (present) imperative, or a direct command. While a subject may be given, it should be assumed that addressee is the subject unless otherwise specified.
- **-ëns** (-ëns) would suggest a past imperative, perhaps a command which has been completed or rescinded, or one which is being relayed from one commander, through another, to another person, similar to, "Boss said to wash up."
- **-ons** (-ons) would suggest a future imperative, possibly a conditional command, similar to, "Go to the ranch when you're finished."

### Gender

While Hylian lacks a formal gender system, it has infixes which can be added to a noun to give it a _natural gender_, which is to say to make a masculine or feminine form of a standard word. Technically, these are pre-suffixes, and follow a particular rule: When gendered, the stress pattern of a word is unchanged -- the gender infixes are invisible to the stress rules, but this means the stress must now be indicated explicitly. This typically means that the last vowel before these infixes receives its _asenta_ form, or an acute accent mark if you are typing in Latin script.

- **-´-il** is the masculine suffix, and indicates a form of the noun which has a male character to it. For example, _hite_ (person) becomes _hítile_ (man).

- **-´-in** is the feminine suffix, and indicates a form of the noun which has a female character to it. For example, _hite_ (person) becomes _hítine_ (woman).

### Counting \& Numbering

In Hylian, numbers are simple roots which can easily become nouns or adjectives. Counting numbers, also called _cardinal_ numbers, always end with the **-e** or **-a** suffix, even if they are logically plural. However, numbers are used in contexts other than counting:

Ordinal numbers change a number from a value to a relation: "one" becomes "first" (or "uno" becomes "primer(o/a)" in spanish). In Hylian, the root of the ordinal is the same as the cardinal, but a pre-suffix is added to the root. Unlike the gender suffixes, this suffix may change the stress pattern of the word.

- **-aS** (-ash) indicates an _ordinal_ number, or one which indicates position within a list or set of related things. This suffix is still followed by a _noun_ or _adjective_ suffix.
