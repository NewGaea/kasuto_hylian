## Auric Trinity concedes:

Well then. What about using Animade for "oblivion" (DAMN! I loved using that move!  :twisted: )
Oh and on the subject of oblivion. I am completely oblivious to subtlies. The "LOL" though effective on a normal mortal was lost on these ears. eheheh

But also:
Lustre - Chaos
Lete-ute-sate-tote-rote-ete
From Luster as in "Black Luster Soldier-Envoy of the Beginning" or its Japanese name "Chaos Soldier-Messenger of Destruction"
(Avid Yugioh collecter/theorist/player. Damn proud of it! I revel in my rentsiness! 8) )

FINALLY! I came up with another new word. I'm considering doing words with Vinny members' names a roots. I have only one so far.

# 513
Onigara
Ote-note-ite-gante-akte-rote-akte
Adj. Drunk/Intoxicated
Derived from "Oni Garo." Got the idea from his avatar.

Venus, I'll let you think up a meaning for "Vekwof e/ag/a/etc." since you know yourself better than I do.  :-)

Thought of another Vinny member word.
#514
Utmastag
Ute-tote-mate-akte-sate-tote-ete
To revive
Derived from OoT Master who, in her early days, pulled a lot of necromancy. (PS OoT Master, this is not a flame. I'm making a humorous allusion to the past/tribute to you. Interpret this as you like, just not as a flame.  :lol: )
