## Venus, Queen of Faeries explains:

Accents are really easy.... I'm sure that I posted the list of how to do them somewhere in this thread. With respect to the accents, though, they're a reflection of how YOU would pronounce the words. So, I ask you: heVONpita or hevonPIta? (and so on.)

There's a word for face... either aikwe and andwe. Something like that. One means face and the other means finger. I've gotten my own words confused. I'll add 'mask' to the list, and also merkle.

We're comin' up on the big five-oh-oh, everyone! Thanks to all who have participated for your help! Together we can make this project take off again, and I hope to hear more from all of you -- and new people too -- in the next five hundred. ^_^!!!

The latter two are the dots you can use to denote a diphthong. It doesn't matter which you use; it's a matter of style. I prefer the former, only because it's easier to see. ^_^
