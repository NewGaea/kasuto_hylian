# Hylian Community Wordlist
---
The following is a truncated archive of a thread (helpfully called _"Suggest New Words"_) in which community members of the Vinculum suggested and discussed words to fill in gaps left by Kasuto's documentation. The biggest contributor was **Venus, Queen of Faeries** and her presumed partner, **K-Chan.** **K-Chan** did not have an account of her own, and all of her contributions are listed within posts from **Venus.** Several other people also came up with quite a few words, rivalling **Venus and K-Chan** over the course of the thread.

There are various interjections by the previous maintainer of this archival documentation, **Austin Springer,** reflecting their thoughts as they produced and archived this data between 2017 and 2021, before they passed the torch to **Jerin of Calatia** in 2023. **Jerin** may add her own thoughts throughout this archive.

## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] adds:

Well, here's an interesting discovery....

Thanks to Darth Citrus, I looked through the OLD kasuto.net files and found a couple more Hylian words. I also have to retract one of my suggestions.... Here are the new words that have been added to my master lists:

**neta** - new
**rektag** - to update

And the word that's been retracted (and probably recycled into a new word):

**\*jiwa** - new

WHEW. These have all been added, by the way, to the dictionary. Oh, Arrow.... I had to change "albe" from "Sacred Realm" to "Holiness" because the meaning fit better. Remember, the Dark World was, at one time, the Sacred Realm, so it made little sense to have two different things for it, especially, when in OoT-era, the Dark World didn't exist yet. The Dark World only came about in LttP-era, which, of course, is well after OoT.

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And _**votoere**_ could still work before that too since the Sacred Realm was a land set apart from Hyrule, full of golden light and power, unlike the normal Hyrule. Not quite an opposite, but close enough to work. Anyways, I changed both of those on my page to match. Thanks again for all your help last night.

## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] gushes:

Thank YOU for all of yours! No way I would have come up with all those words by myself.... and the way you came up with hour, minute and second was brilliant!!

## [Oluademi Wolfwood](contributors/oluademi_wolfwood) emerges from the woodwork:

You do realize that this is ALL YOUR FAULT. ::kicks, then finds a comfy chair in the front of the classroom.::

First of all, 451? Holy shit, V. I knew you guys had it fairly developed but GODDESSES not that well! Of course, my first mission is to learn all of OniGanon's Gerudo rules. Then I'll worry about the Hylian rules. But eh.

While I was scrounging through looking up words for Mikari's broken Hylian, I realized there weren't many words for food. Food is important you know. Not so much specific foods like cheese and fish and roasted cucco. But breakfast and lunch and dinner. 'pologies if you have any of these down already, eh? If anything, you can recycle the words. Oh, and do the whole grammar correct bit too, cuz hell if I know what I'm saying.

So at first I was going to base the words off of breakfast lunch dinner themselves, in some other language maybe. But then I realized, what are they? Meals. When? Prospectively, morning, afternoon, evening. So the quickest and easiest thing to do?

malsete = meal. mahl-seh-teh. literally 'group of food'.
minazisete = breakfast.
tiudrisete = lunch.
na•istrisete = dinner.

Gee, I'm gonna feel real stupid if someone already came up with this.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries remembers:

Actually, Olua... if you remember correctly, there IS a word for fish. You helped make it up. :o

The word you've got for "meal" works, but not its literal translation. The word for food is koeme (and the verb koemag), so no dice there, but if we forgo your translation, it's okay. Also, the pronunciation/spelling must be changed. We can keep the pronunciation of the second syllable as "seh", if we change the spelling to malsëte, but the last syllable HAS to be "tay" not "teh". Otherwise... well, it just doesn't make sense in Hylian.

The word for "morning" (by itself), by the way, is minazE, not minazI. I'd change that, but I think shortening your words is in order. How about we just take until the first vowels, that is, misëte, tisëte and na•isëte?

Also, I've got a few new ones on my own.
hotimag (hoh-TEE-mahg): verb. To smell.
hotime (hoh-TEE-may): noun. Smell; scent.
ai (AH-ee): interjection. Oh! Ah! etc.

---
## Pata Hikari shares some new ideas:

I just thought of something... there are words for the sounds animals make in most lanuages ( I think) So shouldn't Hylian have some?

Bra- For the sound of a dogs bark.

Loc- A Cucco would make this noise.

Any more ideas?

---
## Pata Hikari continues:

Ok, basicly I've worked out a hylian system of measurement, because I doubt they would use ours. =D

First is a matra this is equal to 3 inches. Nine matra make a dënleto. Four dënleto make a chuka. twenty-one chuka make a leto. eleven leto make a teri. And three teri make a maleto

1 maleto = 1.18125 miles (Yes, I did the math.)

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries cheers:

Random numbers are COOL. Yay for the American and Hylian systems of measuring distance!

So I'm guessing that this leto would be the standard unit of measure -- like our mile -- because you've got "big" and "small" versions of it. Also, a chuka is exactly 9 feet. Neat!

Oh, and stick Es on the ends of all the words because they're nouns. :::nod:::

---
## Arrow sighs:

You guys do realize I'm totally going to have to use that distance system for my future fic now, right?  :)

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries is struck by inspiration:

> **OniGanon wrote:**
>
> Directions (up, down, left, right, forward, back, compass points)

More inspiration yesterday. I was thinking that since there are eight elements in the Zelda worlds (Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, Earth and Wind/Air), that each should represent a compass point. Something like when the InuYasha crew was looking for Naraku and they were told something about the direction of the ox and tiger (which is northwest, apparently), if you've seen that particular storyarc.

Anyway. So the elements should each represent one of the eight compass points. But which would go where? I figure the opposites should be opposite each other: Light and Shadow, Fire and Water, Earth and Air. That leaves Forest and Spirit, which aren't opposites per se, but if you figure that a forest is full of life, and a spirit sort of represents the afterlife, then it kind of works.

So now we've got opposites, but where to put them all? I thought that perhaps Light should go in the east, as that's where the sun rises. Shadow would then be west, and that makes sense because by the time the sun's in the west, it's getting dark out. Earth should be on the bottom (south), closest to the earth, and that would make Wind/Air up top (north), which is closest to the sky.

Next, I thought Fire should go in the southwest, between Earth and Shadow, because fires are ground-based and cause death. Water, then, would be in the northeast, between Air and Light because rain comes from the sky and gives life (light). That leaves Forest in the southeast, between Earth and Light, because a forest is an earthy thing, and... life (light), so yeah. Spirit, death and cuz they ascend to heaven or whatever. Either way, this should sum it all up:

Image

Just... don't ask me for names of all the compass directions. ^_^;

---
## Pata Hikari suggests:

One could always use the "Elemental" words for the compass directions. =D

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries inquires:

Of course, but how would we change them so that they're different from the elements themselves? I didn't quite get to that part of the thought. XD

---
## Pata Hikari answers:

Why can't they just be words that you reconize in contrex?

Homonyms are part of every language, and these wouldn't even be true homonyms.

> AS: I agree with this. If you say you went to the element of Spirit it could be simply recognized that you mean you went to the northwest -- there's no need to make a special marking to distinguish the elements from the compass directions, because context exists.

---
## [Auric Trinity](contributors/auric_trinity) offers:

Hey I thought of a word. I don't know if this has been done before (yes I suffer from n00b-itis :roll: ) but here goes:
banshi (ag)
Spelled: bete-akte-note-shïte-ite

Verb
Def: To scream or shriek (from fear or terror)

Root: Banshee

Anyway hope that helps. Hylian rocks! I should learn it as fluently as I know Al Bhed!

Dreh eh Auric Trinity, cekhehk uvv.
Oui cdyo lmycco, Vinculum.

---
## Auric Trinity lewdly proposes:

Sorry about multi posting like this but I just thought of another new word and my memory is so bad that I risk forgetting my new word by typing this explanation. Whatev' here goes:

Zebrakum (ag)

zante-ete-bete-rote-akte-kate-ute-mate

Verb
Def: To eclipse or block light

root: derived from a Lewis Black tirade on the subject of sunblock
"[Sunblock] could be zebra cum, you don't know!"

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries accepts:

Welcome, Auric Trinity, and thanks for your suggestions. Feel free to add more. \^\_\^ Yours and bluelink greg's have been added to the list I've been keeping. If you'd like to see it, just PM/IM/e-mail me. My contact info is available on every post. \^\_\^

---
## Auric Trinity suggests:

> **Venus, Queen of Faeries wrote:**
>
> Of course, but how would we change them so that they're different from the elements themselves?

First a new word

Gate=Pite
SP: pate-ite-tote-ete
Derived from St. Peter at the Golden Gates

Just a suggestion but why not take the elements and attatch "-pite" for a compass direction. Also to say "northern" or "southern" etc. attach
"-pita" (making it an adjective)

so all in all we have:
Solanpite East

Perlunpite Southwest

Anpite Northeast

Molornpite Southeast

Hevonpite Northwest

Galenpite South

Silfanpite North

And:
Solanpita Eastern

Perlunpita Southwestern

Anpita Northwestern

Molornpita Southeastern

Hevonpita Northwestern

Galenpita Southern (y'all)

Silfanpita Northern

You stay classy Vinculum.
I'm Ron Burgundy?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries's jaw drops:

:O Excellent idea, Auric! I'm gonna add all those words to el listo grande.

("Listo" actually means "ready" in Spanish, but I don't care. XD)

Oh, afterthought: should we add accents to preserve the original pronunciation of the words? It's your call, man; you had a brilliant idea, so this is all yours. Until you decide, I'll keep the words in a separate list from the big one.

---
## Auric Trinity bows:

I just don't know how to show accents. accent as you see fit. You're the leader of this movement, mostly. I consider myself a vassal of the Queen

Is there a Hylian word for "face?" Because "mask" could just be face put on the same formula with "-oke."

One more thing:

merkle
SP: mate-ente-rote-lete-kate-ente
monument/gravestone
derived from Merkle (rhymes with Steve Erkul (sp?)) Monuments, a small business near where I live.

Accent as you see fit, my liege.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries explains:

Accents are really easy.... I'm sure that I posted the list of how to do them somewhere in this thread. With respect to the accents, though, they're a reflection of how YOU would pronounce the words. So, I ask you: heVONpita or hevonPIta? (and so on.)

There's a word for face... either aikwe and andwe. Something like that. One means face and the other means finger. I've gotten my own words confused. I'll add 'mask' to the list, and also merkle.

We're comin' up on the big five-oh-oh, everyone! Thanks to all who have participated for your help! Together we can make this project take off again, and I hope to hear more from all of you -- and new people too -- in the next five hundred. ^_^!!!

The latter two are the dots you can use to denote a diphthong. It doesn't matter which you use; it's a matter of style. I prefer the former, only because it's easier to see. ^_^

---
## Auric Trinity shrugs:

I'd accent whichever syllable comes before the "-pite." In this context I consider -pite a suffix, i.e. not receiving an accent. Plus Hevonpite rolls off the tounge better than Hevonpite.

So with Compass directions, syllable before -pite is accented.

New word for "Axe": Garsite
Pronounced: gar-SEE-tay
Sp: Gante-akte-rote-sate-ite-tote-ete
Root: Garcia of Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones

EDIT: Thanks for that list Venus.

EDIT (AGAIN?!): Dari! You're right! My bad! :oops:

---
## Auric Trinity offers:

Esterag- To insult
ënte-sate-tote-ënte-rote-akte-gante
Derived from: The Latin "Esterans" meaning "burning" (Esterans interius, Ira vehementi-Burning inside with violent anger)
From burn I thought of "flame" like the kind that can get you banned from this board.XD

OMG!! 491!! I'll be #500 if it kills me!  :twisted:

493!!! :twisted:
Kepla - Spare/leftover (adj)
Sp: Kate-ënte-pate-lete-akte
Derived from Andrew Kepple aka Too Much Spare Time: Animator of French Erotic Film and Zero Wing Rhapsody

Navie - Annoyance Note-akte-vete-ite-ete
Navia - Annoying Note-akte-vete-ite-akte

Four more!!!!! I shall RETURN!!

>

497!!!  :twisted:

Dawëna - Foolish/stupid/idiotic
Date-akte-wante-ënte-note-akte
Derived from Darwin Awards

Wish me luck. I have an audition for the Baltimore County honors Jazz Band. cya!

498!!
Imatoe - Candy/sweet tasting food
Sp: Ite-mate-akte-tote-ote-ete
Derived from Japanese for "now" (ima) and "after/later" (ato)

499
Skolire - Shield
Sate-kate-ote-lete-ite-rote-ete
Derived from C Paolini's "Ancient Language" Skolir for shield
(Hylian's an ancient language so the two could be similar. Also the primary speakers are Elvish looking. A.L. by elves Hilana by Hylians)

500!!!!!111!!one  :twisted:

Anperine - Liquor (sp?)
A compound of "An" and "perin" (Water and soul)
I thought of "wine and spirits" Getting drunk seems to give one a different soul.

1337!!! I AM #500!! :twisted:  :D

---
## Auric Trinity catches his breath:

Well sorry about this double post, but no one's been here for a couple of days so I'm making sure that it isn't forgotten.

But do not fear! I come with new words.

Word #501
Mahoe - mage
mate-akte-hënte-ote-ete
Derived from the Japanese word for magic "Mahou"
Furthermore this can be combined with an element to designate a specific type of mage:
Ex: Galanmahoe=Earth mage
Hevonmahoe=Spirit mage

Word #502
Tsukae - operator/user/wielder
Tote-sate-ute-kate-akte-tote-ete
Derived from Japanese verb "Tsukau," to use
This can also be compounded with a weapon (-its "ete" ending.) to denote a warrior that uses that weapon:
Ex: Katentsukae= Swordsman
Garsitsukae= Axewielder, etc.

And finally...
Word #503
Mevine- master of a skill
Mate-ete-vete-ite-note-ete
Derived from "mevyn" (sp?)
This is also capable of being compounded with either of the two above words to denote mastery of a certain art or stand alone as a generic term for a master in the same sense. (i.e. this does NOT mean master in the sense of a commander.)
Ex: Hevonmahomevine= Master spirit mage
Katentsukamevine= Master swordsman (Swordmaster)

Hope to see lots of new faces (or avatars as the case may be :roll: ) here.
Only 497 until the thousandth word.

## [XenonnMaximus](contributors/xenonnmaximus) writes:

How about Malangeld. It's a combination of Maligned(looks fine but doesn't work) and Mangeld /mangled/ (looks broken but may still work). It means looks terrible and it doesn't work.

Don't be too hard on me it's my first time posting on something like this.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries jokes:

D: THAT IS A TERRIBLE SUGGESTION AND YOU SHOULD NEVER POST HERE AGAIN EW GO AWAY.

LOL I'm just kidding, of course. I'll add it, and yours too, Auric. ^_^ (It's spelled "mangled", by the way.) Xennon, you've got a PM from me.

Auric: I've just remembered, I've got a word on the list that means TO shield, to cover, to guard, etc. Here's what I suggest: your word should be the equipment shield, mine will be general protection (the same way you can use a garbage can lid in a snowball fight). How's that sound? I also have a suggestion: vomevine, for a novice or beginner. ^_^

Also, Auric, I've noticed that you've got a "ts" combo going on in there. "Ts" was actually planned to be its own letter (see the old thread, here. Actually, I'm glad to have linked to that; now it won't take me ages to find it again). I think, the same way that we use "ch" as one letter, that we'll have to do the same for "ts". Let me know what you think, before I add that one, and also check out the other planned letters, too. Note: the thread was created over three years ago, but the letters were never added -- officially -- to the language or the font.

---
## Auric Trinity raises an eyebrow:

To quote Jack Sparrow, *grabbed at throat by skeletal hand* "Well that's interesting." I was unaware of a ch, ts, etc.

In that light, "ts" will be the way to go not "tote sate" for tsukae

As far as your suggestion on "Skolire" goes, OKBYME.

As for my usual suggestion in a post.

#507
Dorobe - Thief
Date-ote-rote-ote-bete-ete
Derived from the Japanese "Dorobo" meaning thief

Logically, this would make "Dorobag" to steal and making it #508

> There's already a word for thief, **_diebe,_** from Kasuto. Your word will fit well in a different place, though.

Oh and "vomevine" sounds great, it even sounds n00bish.

---
## Venus, Queen of Fairies points out:

Gee, thanks. :/ LOL How's it sound great and n00bish at the same time?

Vo- is the prefix meaning un-, im-, in-, etc.; basically, it negates whatever follows. I figured an "un-master" would be a novice.

There's actually a word for thief, already, one of Kasuto's creations, "diebe". Your words are similar, though. Interesting. :o

---
## Auric Trinity nods:

When I said n00bish I meant in pronounciation. Phoenetically it sounds sort of shaky and unsure, like a novice. You are, as usual, a Hilanmevinne the Chaos Overlord meant no offense.

Animade - pain
Akte-note-ite-mate-akte-date-ete
Derived from Anima the Dark Aeon of FF X. (special attack: pain)

Ma & Dën modify levels of pain: i.e. Manimade=Agony and Dënanimade=mild discomfort

---
## Venus, Queen of Fairies observes:

Oh, none was taken. I meant the "gee thanks" jokingly. I guess it didn't come across too well, even with the LOL right there. Sorry!

D: We've got a word for pain, too. It's ite, homophonous with the letter. (Anima's Pain attack was kinda scary. I got this unnerving chill whenever he did it.)

---
## Auric concedes:

Well then. What about using Animade for "oblivion" (DAMN! I loved using that move!  :twisted: )
Oh and on the subject of oblivion. I am completely oblivious to subtlies. The "LOL" though effective on a normal mortal was lost on these ears. eheheh

But also:
Lustre - Chaos
Lete-ute-sate-tote-rote-ete
From Luster as in "Black Luster Soldier-Envoy of the Beginning" or its Japanese name "Chaos Soldier-Messenger of Destruction"
(Avid Yugioh collecter/theorist/player. Damn proud of it! I revel in my rentsiness! 8) )

FINALLY! I came up with another new word. I'm considering doing words with Vinny members' names a roots. I have only one so far.

# 513
Onigara
Ote-note-ite-gante-akte-rote-akte
Adj. Drunk/Intoxicated
Derived from "Oni Garo." Got the idea from his avatar.

Venus, I'll let you think up a meaning for "Vekwof e/ag/a/etc." since you know yourself better than I do.  :-)

Thought of another Vinny member word.
#514
Utmastag
Ute-tote-mate-akte-sate-tote-ete
To revive
Derived from OoT Master who, in her early days, pulled a lot of necromancy. (PS OoT Master, this is not a flame. I'm making a humorous allusion to the past/tribute to you. Interpret this as you like, just not as a flame.  :lol: )

## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

Interesting T-M combination there, Auric.

I found a word from long, long ago that I credit to Kasuto:

kanshise (kahn-SHEE-say): noun. Guardian.

I choose "lively" as the meaning for vekwofa. No matter what mood I'm really in, I can always act happy and spirited and cheerful on the outside. Pansale dëme pante! W00T!

>

It's unsurprising that I've kept a list of all the words we've got so far, so if anyone's worried (all, like, one of me), nothing here, at least, was lost, except for the posts.

>

So, yes. I'm back, but only for a moment, to post a new word that someone actually e-mailed to me.

Awesome!

The word is merke, derived from "mercury" to mean "metal". Okay? Okay. Dictionary's been updated.

---
## [Dagger341](contributors/dagger341) writes:

Yay! my first post! I can now share my creativity with the world! Ok here's my first posted word. How about plute meaning "one who works with metal" or "smith" then plutag could be "to work with metal" or "to smith" both are the same statement, but I want to be as clear as possible. How's that for a first-timer? Let me know what you guys think. Oh yeah, and keep the language alive! :D

So, I also think it's strange that I've had two requests for the dictionary in the past two days. :O!

Oh, and happy Halloween. ^_^

## [Stella](contributors/stella_snile) writes:

Hi i'm back, my old user snile seems to be deleted so I made a new one.
Well on with the words.

It have botherd me for some while that there only was on gemstone in the langue; siafire . so it took a look on the word, the first part sia which means blue caugth my attention, what if the other gemstones also started whith their color?
then it would be:

Miafire ruby
Sihiafire emerald
Simiafire amethyst
Hiafire topaz

For diamond there would be used a word which means white or clear. I'll go whith white. For white I have made the word Via drived from the Norewgian word for white hvit.
Then we have:

Viafire diamond

## Venus, Queen of Fairies smiles:

Yya, new faces!!! Sorry about the hiatus, you guys. I'm usually quick to respond to new posts, but I was avoiding all game-related forums until my completion of Twilight Princess.

Oh my Goddesses.

Anyway, I thank you for your contributions. I need to get to bed soon, but your words seem good, and I'll look them over more carefully when I get home from work. Thank you so much!

>

I'm glad the gemstones caught your attention, Stella. Did you know that I derived the word for blue FROM the word for sapphire? XD I'm glad you followed.

And Dagger, I've got your words, too. (The other planets should get words if the dwarf gets one. Tee hee.)

Total count: 571.

---
## Stella offers:

Great minds think alike^^

I got a new word this time I have entered the bug world.

Myre Ant

Myre is made from the swedish word for ant: myra (I use to call my sister myra^^ so I have to thank her for this word)

wow, i'm getting into this, i'm working on new words all the time.

---
## Sage of Silence asks:

I'll admit, I'm lazy and don't want to look in 13 pages of posts, but I was wondering, is there a Hylian word for "until" yet? Right now, I'm using "az", for "to the", but until would suit the phrase much better. It's for a fanfic I'm working on (and is in the post your own fanfic section, if you'd like to get a better idea on how until/to the is being used). I don't know enough about how the language is constructed to suggest a word myself. If there is one, could someone let me know?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries answers:

Until = jade

---

## Dagger341 offers:

well I guess I can make words that please all the planet-lovers. (no offense to anyone)
Venag - to marry
Martag - to fight
Satutag - to time

that's all for now. will get more soon.

---

## Venus, Queen of Fairies smiles:

I like my verb. ^_^!! (With the last one, what exactly do you mean? Like, measuring time?)

Stella, if you've got a modified pronunciation for me, it would really help. But no rush. ^_^

---
## Rayven offers:

Venus, if Im translating what Stella said correctly, it should me something like me-reh. or something.

I DO read this section, though I dont post here. Ill learn the langueage some day, maybe.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries nods:

That's what I think, too, Rayven, but I just want to doublecheck before I etch it in stone (i.e., scribble it in Notepad). I don't wanna commit it to memory if it's wrong, you know? It's a bitch to learn to pronounce things another way than the way you learned it.

And thanks for reading. I do appreciate it. ^_^

By the way, Dagger341, I'm so sorry. D: Two of those words have already been thought up, BUT, we'll hold onto venag (exisiting word: ipag) and martag (existing word: reaketag) for something else. If you do mean the third for measuring time, we'll keep it, but I wanna make sure, so I haven't added it to the list yet.

And that list is in sore need of a re-count. I probably skipped something, somewhere.

---
## Dagger341 apologizes:

well how about Martag mean "to war"? I do not believe that is taken. Venag could be "to inspire". Yes I did intend Satutag to be in reference to mesuring time. I also have other words to add.

Jhutag - to storm

and in a different form Jhute - storm
also if you take the noun forms of the other words they should be

Marte - war
Venag - inspiration
and Satute - total time

Unless there is something I missed these are all new. I could br wrong of course. Venus apparently there are words that I missed. Would you send me an updated version of the word list and pronunciations? Thanks.

on a different note has anyone developed a dictionary sorted by part of speech? Is it even a good idea?

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries writes:

We've actually got ilidane for "storm (noun)," but we could use jhutag for the verb, if that's cool.

The other words seem good, so I'll add those, and yes, I'll send you an updated version of the list. I'm really sorry if the one I sent was inaccurate.

And if you'll e-mail me about it, ANYONE who wants an updated list will receive one when we reach six hundred original words. After that, it's up to you guys to keep track, but I'll do it this one time. ^_^ Incentive to keep up the good work. Really, I'm suprised, impressed, elated and humbled at the amount of suggestions we've received lately. Everyone's doing a lovely job, and I feel bad that I haven't come up with very many myself. XD

Um, once I get bored enough, I'll do the parts-of-speech list. ^_^;; I'm working every day through Sunday at least, so I'm kinda busy now, but maybe I'll get on it on my next day off.

EDIT: Seven new words added, and Dagger341, did you mean "inspiration" to be venage? Only you left off the E and vene is a naughty word. :3 I added it to the dictionary already, but if it wasn't meant to be venage, just let me know. Thanks!

---
## Dagger341 blushes:

Thank you for fixing that for me. I cant find that word in the dictionary so I have no idea what I said. Ok, now I feel silly. I thought for sure that I had not seen "storm" anywhere. oh well. New word.

folbiukoge - earthquake (taken from folkag and biukoge. Literally "rolling earth").

Yes. Its cool. Use it. If something I do helps, then by all means use it.
On the subject of the parts of speech dictionary I do have one started. I have the pronouns and most of the verbs done. I hope this helps. Please send the revised version when you get the chance. Thank you for your time.

---
## Venus, Queen of Faeries snaps her fingers:

Ah, there's word I've forgotten to suggest:

-krohi (KROH-hee): suffix. Used to indicate a member of the Royal Guard.

/This marks the end of the actual Suggest New Words thread. The words contained in this list will be moved into a dedicated Community Dictionary./
