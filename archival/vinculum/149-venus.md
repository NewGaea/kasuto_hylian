## Venus, Queen of Faeries nods:

That's what I think, too, [[rayven|Rayven]], but I just want to doublecheck before I etch it in stone (i.e., scribble it in Notepad). I don't wanna commit it to memory if it's wrong, you know? It's a bitch to learn to pronounce things another way than the way you learned it.

And thanks for reading. I do appreciate it. ^_^

By the way, [[dagger341|Dagger341]], I'm so sorry. D: Two of those words have already been thought up, BUT, we'll hold onto venag (exisiting word: ipag) and martag (existing word: reaketag) for something else. If you do mean the third for measuring time, we'll keep it, but I wanna make sure, so I haven't added it to the list yet.

And that list is in sore need of a re-count. I probably skipped something, somewhere.
