## [[magnas|Magnas]] requests:

When you're done that, maybe you could make it into an HTML file that will include all that, if you're capable? It may help you sort it out. Just a suggestion for now  :D I don't have anything else to add, since I'm not really capable of suggesting new words ATM. If you don't know HTML, I can use it as practice once you're done and try to do that for you (once I understand the language and all).
