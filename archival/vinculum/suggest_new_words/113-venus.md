## Venus, Queen of Faeries remembers:

Actually, Olua... if you remember correctly, there IS a word for fish. You helped make it up. :o

The word you've got for "meal" works, but not its literal translation. The word for food is koeme (and the verb koemag), so no dice there, but if we forgo your translation, it's okay. Also, the pronunciation/spelling must be changed. We can keep the pronunciation of the second syllable as "seh", if we change the spelling to malsëte, but the last syllable HAS to be "tay" not "teh". Otherwise... well, it just doesn't make sense in Hylian.

The word for "morning" (by itself), by the way, is minazE, not minazI. I'd change that, but I think shortening your words is in order. How about we just take until the first vowels, that is, misëte, tisëte and na•isëte?

Also, I've got a few new ones on my own.
hotimag (hoh-TEE-mahg): verb. To smell.
hotime (hoh-TEE-may): noun. Smell; scent.
ai (AH-ee): interjection. Oh! Ah! etc.
