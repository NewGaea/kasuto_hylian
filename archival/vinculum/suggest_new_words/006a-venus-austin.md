AS: This is a good observation -- it is likely generic "boy" and "girl" words can be derived backwards from this, since the -il and -in gender suffixes are both present. Back-derivation suggests _kime_ for child, _kímile_ for boy, and _kímine_ for girl.


> Great- (as in great-grandfather or great-aunt): _ma'_ (so that great-grandfather would be "masófile") From my previous suggestion for "big."
> 
> Half- (as in half-sister): _dëna'_ (so that half-sister would be "dënasípine") From my previous suggestion for "little." I'm changing "little/small" from "dën" to "dëna" since it's an adjective, and all adjetives must end in A.

> Note: "ma" and "dëna" in these cases would not mean "big" or "little," but indicate more of a hierarchy of terms. "**Dënasípine**," then, would not mean "little sister" or "younger sister", but rather "half sister", indicating that one is not as close to a half sister as a full sister. Similarly, "**masófile**" would not indicate one's elder grandfather, but rather, someone older THAN one's grandfather, who should be one's grandfather's father, or one's great-grandfather. Don't worry about it if I've confused you. It's just one of those weird things about language. Trust me when I say that it makes perfect sense in my head. But if you do understand it, then good for you! You can help me explain it to others! ^_^

AS: It really is a nice idea, but I'm not 100% certain I want to go exactly this way. I'll review this once the community wordlist is finalised.

> Step- (e.g., stepfather): **ipa'** (stepfather is "ipapiántile") From "**ipae**", previously mentioned to mean "spouse." "**Ipapiántile**" would have a literal translation as "spouse-father," which could be interpreted as a father-by-marriage, which is precisely what a stepfather is. I suppose it could also refer to inlaws, and differentiated by context. Haven't exactly worked this one out.

AS: I love this one, though, it's a great way to distinguish blood relations from legal ones!
