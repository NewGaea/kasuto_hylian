You know, I just realized how well my words work together, and it was totally unintentional....

I suggested "**mámale**" for million, and then I later said that "**ma-**" should be a prefix for "big." "**Mámale**" would (could) be short for "_malan malën_" (AS: it would probably actually be _male do male_ ) or it could be "big _male_." Either way, it works. Nifty, ne?
