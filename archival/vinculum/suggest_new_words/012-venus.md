Hmm. A little difficult, but I bet I can knock them off with practice.

Okay, I've got a couple of more words, too. Inspired by a little speech I plan to have a character making in the future:

**mo•iag** (MOY-ahg): to hear, to listen. (And note that it includes the "o•i" letter (o•ite), which is NOT listed in the alphabet, but used in the particle "sho•i.") I took the Spanish "oír," for "hear" and part of "comprendar." I would have used more of "comprendar" but I was also planning to use "kiku," Japanese for "to listen to." Then I remembered that there were way more words that started with K than any other letter, so I scrapped the whole thing. Mo•iag was the result.

**mejag** (MEH-jahg): to resemble, to look like. Taken from Spanish "asemejarse," to resemble.

**zavokag** (zah-VOH-kahg): to know, to understand. Taken from French "savoir," to know. I changed the S to a Z because every time I said it, it came out that way. :p There's also a K from the Japanese "wakaru," to know. I can't seem to stay away from those Japanese Ks, can I? LOL.
