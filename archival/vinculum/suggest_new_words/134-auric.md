## Auric Trinity raises an eyebrow:

To quote Jack Sparrow, *grabbed at throat by skeletal hand* "Well that's interesting." I was unaware of a ch, ts, etc.

In that light, "ts" will be the way to go not "tote sate" for tsukae

As far as your suggestion on "Skolire" goes, OKBYME.

As for my usual suggestion in a post.

#507
Dorobe - Thief
Date-ote-rote-ote-bete-ete
Derived from the Japanese "Dorobo" meaning thief

Logically, this would make "Dorobag" to steal and making it #508

Oh and "vomevine" sounds great, it even sounds n00bish.
