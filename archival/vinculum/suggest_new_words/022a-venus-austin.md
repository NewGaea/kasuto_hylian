## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Fairies]] indulges:

> I was thinking that since I mentioned _N_ and _L,_ I could use that for gender itself. Simply, "_ne_" and "_na_" for "female" and "_le_" and "_la_" for male ("female" and "male" can be either a noun or an adjective, depending on usage; mostly adjectives). With that done, the underwear problem is solved. "_DÃ«nusheokine_" ceases to exist because the "_in_" at the end implies the noun is a sentient being, and underwear most certainly is not.

I strongly disagree with your assumption that the _-il_ and _-in_ suffixes imply sentience or personhood -- they may be used to mark a semantic gender, but even a semantic gender can be a gender based on association rather than literal sex. Just think about terms like "man-bun" or "boyshorts" -- both of these have a semantic gender even though neither the bun nor shorts involved have a physical gender (indeed, _boyshorts_ are, in my experience, a feminine garment).
