## [[emekthian]] responds:

> hraiäte- hr-eye-at-ey

AS: _raiät_ or _harät_ seems like a reasonable form that feels consistent with Kasuto's lexicon

> shoyanne- sh-oh-yahn-ney

AS: _shoyane_ seems reasonable enough since Hylian does not have any official long consonants

> ktaniyuhrozag- ktah-nee-you-hroh-zahg

AS: Yeah, uh, Hylian certainly lacks several of these. Let's shuffle the letters a bit: _tanikyurozag_ the only dropped letter is the _h_.
