## [[qbri|QBri]] waits patiently:

Hey I hate to double post, but I think these suggestions would go better in this topic:

Definite & Indefinite pronouns:

* _toka_ - all; _toke_ - everything (noun form of toka)
* **toa** - some; **toe** - something ✅
* **boka** - none; **boke** - nothing ✅

I could come up with factors for people (everyone, someone, etc.) and for time but I'll let someone else do it for now. I figured these would work out well because Venus just came up with the word toa.

2 other pronouns:

* **ala** - there ✅
* **aka** - here (from spanish aqui) ✅

Conjunction:
**sëk** - but ✅
**moa** (moh-ah) - also ✅

PREPOSITIONS
*side note* I really like the ambiguity of the word "ank," to me it works well almost a particle that marks the indirect object, (i.e.- it shows to whom/what/where the action is placed and thus can be used to mean "to, on, at, for") Thus, I suggest that "ank" be used as such and then we don't have to waste time memorizing other words for "for" or "at" (I'm aware that "ont" and "ënt" are already created and I think they should be used as normal) but in other instances where a indirect object needs to be marked, I personally think "ank" works well.*end side note*

* **tok** - with (from japanese "to") ✅

Other prepositions that need to be translated:
until, by, as, at (I think there's already a word for this but I can't remember), into, about, between, than, since...

That's all I got for now.
