## [[pata-hikari|Pata Hikari]] thinks deeply:

I've been thinking, and I produced two new words.

**Lincre** Courage, the root for the Hylian name Linc ^_^;;

**Zeldne** Wisdom, the root word for the Hylian name Zelda : P

If either of these words have been made...well, the school filter is blocking my ascess to the dictionary :o

**Moldrme** The 'orginal' Hylian prounanation of the monster Moldorm

**Moblne** The 'Orginal' Hylian of the monster Moblin
