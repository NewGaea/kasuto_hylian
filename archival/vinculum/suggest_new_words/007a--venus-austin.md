You'll be pleased to know you've got nearly 300 words, not counting what's in the dictionary! :D But I digress), and I ran across a couple that were repeated, but had different meanings in Hylian and I was wondering if you could clear them up for me.

The only conclusion I could draw was that you decided to change the words halfway through and didn't change it on ALL of the pages, so I'm sort of confused as to which means what.

AS: Pronouns ending in _a_ are "adjectival pronouns" or demonstratives, as in "_za lërde_ => that book" while pronouns ending in _u_ are independent pronouns, as in "_zu tairas bagu'sa lërde_ => that is my book"

AS: This was an interesting recognition. It might be the difference between the simple act and composition or formal writing, or even dictation?

> **Ordinal numbers:** Take the stem and add "_-ashe_" for the noun, "_-asha_" for the adjective. I understand that. You have "fourth book" as "_koshasa lërde_" and I'm wondering if that's a mistake and it should be "_koasha lërde_."

AS: Actually, it should be _kosasha_ -- the _s_ is dropped for _-dëme_ and _-sale_ due to an undescribed phonological process that dislikes consonant clusters.
