## [[oniganon|OniGanon]] observes:

Hmm... one thing about Kasuto's Hylian is that the words are usually pretty easy to pronounce. It's a bit like Japanese, in that it doesn't often have two consonants in a row. So sounds like _hr_ and _kt,_ while possible, don't fit so well with Kasuto's Hylian.

Of course this is just my opinion. It's up to Kasuto of course.
