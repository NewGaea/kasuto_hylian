## Austin's Commentary

While natural languages do not always follow their rules so strictly, Hylian is artificial and follows a highly engineered set of paradigms. Perhaps keeping the ball in Kasuto's court, so to speak, is the better option than saying "weird exceptions." With that said -- the ball in Kasuto's court has _no rule at all_ for the ending of prepositions, with the best candidates being _-o_ for prepositions and _-ok_ for adverbs.
