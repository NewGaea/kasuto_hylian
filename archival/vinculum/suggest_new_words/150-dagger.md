## [[dagger341|Dagger341]] apologizes:

well how about Martag mean "to war"? I do not believe that is taken. Venag could be "to inspire". Yes I did intend Satutag to be in reference to mesuring time. I also have other words to add.

Jhutag - to storm

and in a different form Jhute - storm
also if you take the noun forms of the other words they should be

Marte - war
Venag - inspiration
and Satute - total time

Unless there is something I missed these are all new. I could br wrong of course. Venus apparently there are words that I missed. Would you send me an updated version of the word list and pronunciations? Thanks.

on a different note has anyone developed a dictionary sorted by part of speech? Is it even a good idea?
