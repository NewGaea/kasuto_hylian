Holy crap, dude. Hylian is missing some very key words. Here's a few I suggest, and you can be sure that more shalt come.

abandonment - adenbe âœ…
abandon - adenbag âœ…
make (to create) - hedag ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
make/force (to make a person...) - impelag âœ…
house - albode (mixture of alba and abode) âœ…
home - albende ğŸ’¬ (as _albodi_)
life - alvire ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
live - alvirag ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
sickness, illness - malborge ğŸ›‘ (declined)
evil - malbage ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to prior suggestion _kÃ«ume_)
want - volag ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
see - mirag ğŸ›‘ (declined in deference to Kasuto's dictinary)
much, more/many - tra, trazwa

EDIT: Also, I don't know if there are any rules for conjunctions, but I suggest using "si" for the word "if". I also suggest using "kok" as the negative forming word. I checked the list you gave me and I haven't seen any ways to make a word negative.
