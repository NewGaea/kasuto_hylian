## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] agrees:

Those are good suggestions, and I won't hesitate to add them once we figure out what to make them end in. (For those of you just joining us,) Hylian's a grammar-coded language, so we can't have prepositions like jade ending in E when singular nouns end in E. The other problem is that Hylian prepositions don't have a set ending.

That said, we need to pick one. For reference, this is our super-complete list of prepositions as we have them right now:

* _ak_ (ahk): preposition. To.
* _bado_ (BAH-doh): preposition. After.
* _da•ia_ (DIE-ah): preposition. Of.
* _depoto_ (day-POH-toh): preposition. Before.
* _do•ia_ (DOY-ah): preposition. From.
* _ënt_ (ehnt): preposition. In. Used to define a place.
* **_jade_** (JAH-day): preposition. Until.
* **_ol_** (ohl): preposition. Than.
* _ont_ (ohnt): preposition. In. Used to define time.
* **_pro_** (proh): preposition. For.
* **_tok_** (tohk): preposition. With.
* _yaz_ (yahz): preposition. Already.

As you can see, they're all over the place. I like the consonants, so what if we made them all end in -l (like ol) or z (like yaz)? It's up to you guys. I'm a fan of L, myself.
