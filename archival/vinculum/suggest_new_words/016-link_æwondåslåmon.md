That's a very interesting language, [[emekthian]], though I've always imagined the Kokiris speaking a much more beautiful language, without any uvular sound. :roll: I've never thought of making an own language for the Kokiris. In my fan fics they're speaking ancient Hylian, my own version of Hylian. :) The text below is written in my Hylian. In that language there are no uvular sounds, only beautiful sounds (might be because I only like beautiful sounds and don't wanna make a language that elves would think of as distasteful). :) But, you've done a great job.
