## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] wonders:

Merriam Webster Online (what I use to double check parts of speech) says _here_ and _there_ are adverbs. o\_o I don't understand that, because you'd think "here" would take the place of "this place" and "there" would take the place of "that place", but maybe since "this" and "that" are adjectives, "here" and "there" MUST be adverbs. \@\_\@ Yay English. I really need to take some linguistics courses. What about a word for *way* over there? Can we have one of those? I like those.

I don't understand the _toka/toa/boka_ bit. What's with "all toke" "some toe" and "none boke"? Sorry.... But, if _toka_ means all, and _toa_ means some (_boka_ means none, then?), everyone (everybody) would be all people, or _tokan hitën._ BUT, it's a pronoun, so it's got to end in _-u_, and _tokan hitënu_ is kinda long, so if anyone's got an idea, great. Same for no one (nobody). Someone is different, though.

I could swear we already had a word for "_also_".... but I agree with your note on prepositions. Let's just use _ank_ for everything.
