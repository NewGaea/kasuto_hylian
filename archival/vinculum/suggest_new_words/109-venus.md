Words that, as yet, are not translated into English (this is where you help!):

* kalda
* ha•ita

And I'm sure there are a couple of others that have been left out over time, too. ;-;

WHEW. These have all been added, by the way, to the dictionary. Oh, [[contributors/arrow|Arrow]].... I had to change "_albe_" from "Sacred Realm" to "Holiness" because the meaning fit better. Remember, the Dark World was, at one time, the Sacred Realm, so it made little sense to have two different things for it, especially, when in OoT-era, the Dark World didn't exist yet. The Dark World only came about in LttP-era, which, of course, is well after OoT.
