D: THAT IS A TERRIBLE SUGGESTION AND YOU SHOULD NEVER POST HERE AGAIN EW GO AWAY.

LOL I'm just kidding, of course. I'll add it, and yours too, Auric. ^_^ (It's spelled "mangled", by the way.) Xennon, you've got a PM from me.

[[auric-trinity|Auric]]: I've just remembered, I've got a word on the list that means TO shield, to cover, to guard, etc. Here's what I suggest: your word should be the equipment shield, mine will be general protection (the same way you can use a garbage can lid in a snowball fight). How's that sound? I also have a suggestion: vomevine, for a novice or beginner. \^\_\^

Also, Auric, I've noticed that you've got a "ts" combo going on in there. "Ts" was actually planned to be its own letter (see the old thread, [[six_new_letters|here]]. Actually, I'm glad to have linked to that; now it won't take me ages to find it again). I think, the same way that we use "ch" as one letter, that we'll have to do the same for "ts". Let me know what you think, before I add that one, and also check out the other planned letters, too. Note: the thread was created over three years ago, but the letters were never added -- officially -- to the language or the font.
