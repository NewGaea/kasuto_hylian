Remember, the Dark World was, at one time, the Sacred Realm, so it made little sense to have two different things for it, especially, when in OoT-era, the Dark World didn't exist yet. The Dark World only came about in LttP-era, which, of course, is well after OoT.

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And _**votoere**_ could still work before that too since the Sacred Realm was a land set apart from Hyrule, full of golden light and power, unlike the normal Hyrule. Not quite an opposite, but close enough to work. Anyways, I changed both of those on my page to match. Thanks again for all your help last night.
