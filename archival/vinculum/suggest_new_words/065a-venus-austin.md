> I was looking through the [[archival/kasuto_hli/wayback|ooooooold Kas.net]] (thanks, Lysia!) and found the old Hylian Language. Well, not much has changed in three and a half years, but a few words did, most notably hello and good-bye. Hello used to be **_batá•í_** (bah-TIE), and now it's _oha•io_ (oh-HIGH-oh). Goodbye used to be **_jhënta•i_** (JHEHN-tie) and now it's _sajaná•í_ (Sah-jah-NIGH). (The words for fire and righteousness only changed by pronunciation and apostrophe, respectively.)

> I like _batá•í_ and _jhënta•i_. We should use them for something, don't you think? (I actually like _batá•í_ for hello a lot better than _oha•io_.)

I agree -- I actually note that _batai_ seems more closely related to the still-current _bënkati_ used in greeting or welcoming people, so perhaps both of these words can be kept as traditional or formal ways say "hello" and "goodbye".
