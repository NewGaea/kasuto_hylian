:O Excellent idea, Auric! I'm gonna add all those words to _el listo grande._

("_Listo_" actually means "ready" in Spanish, but I don't care. XD)

Oh, afterthought: should we add accents to preserve the original pronunciation of the words? It's your call, man; you had a brilliant idea, so this is all yours. Until you decide, I'll keep the words in a separate list from the big one.
