## [[bbb|BBB]] gratefully nods:

I don't mind at all that an _e_ must be added. It further distances it from the Greek word which is desireable if you want to make the Hylian language individual.

However I do think the words:
Cuccos, Keese, guays,and teketites should be considered Hylian words because there is no possible translation into English. (Except perhaps giant, jumpey' one eyed bug type creature and peck out the eyes bird.)
I also thougt that a good word for skeleton would be _stal_, as in the _stal_ in _stalfos_. And perhaps _fos_ could be added to somethings name as a term of fear, like skeleton-monster or wolf-monster (_wolfos_). Although there could be a word for both already in Kasutos dictionary.
