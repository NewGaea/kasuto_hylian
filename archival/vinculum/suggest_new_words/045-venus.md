Well, they are... their spellings just need to be modified a teeny bit to fit Kasuto's grammar rules. I only copied things verbatum [sic]; I didn't touch anything (though I added batyahe as a word for valley. I think that sounds pretty cool. Think you could use it, [[oniganon|OniGanon]]?).

Oooh, I like that. It's so amazingly simple. _Stale_ for skeleton (remember, nouns end in -e), _fose_ for fear, and maybe _fosa_ for afraid? There's no word for wolf... but there's a word for dog.
