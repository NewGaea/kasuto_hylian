You can pronounce 2 n's in a row. There are plenty of languages that even make a distinction between, say "kanor" and "kannor". Just because a word is hard for someone used to speaking English doesn't mean it's impossible to pronounce.

Anyway, some words:

**hrai√§te** - praise
**shoyanne** - explosive
**ktaniyuhrozag** - to exasperate
