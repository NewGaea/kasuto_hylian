Just like I promised last month in "[[hylian-letter-c|Is there a Hylian letter for C?]]" topic, the list of words **[[k-chan|KChan]]** and I made up. There aren't very many, but I hope it helps. I also have the complete list of Hylian words **[Kasuto](contributors/kasuto)** made up, in case anyone wants it, and a list of words we should probably tackle first, suggestion-wise. Without further ado:

* Alone -- **anlika**
* Angry -- **reathoa**
* Bat -- **keese** (so named for the baddie) (AS: => adapted to **kíse**)
* Battle -- **reakete**
* Belief -- **geleáfae**
* Believe -- **geleafag**
* Big -- ma- (prefix); **ma**
* Blue -- **sia**
* Boot -- **kamoke**
* Chance/Luck -- **jheluke**
* Chicken -- **kukoe**
* Fly (verb)-- **moskag** (Inspired by Spanish "mosca," for the insect.)
* Ghost -- **poe**, **ginie** (so named for the baddies)
* Glove -- **namoke**
* Green -- **sihia**
* Hat -- **chapoke**
* Leg -- **none**
* Leggings -- **nonoke**
* Lucky -- **jhelúkea**
* Million -- **mámale**
* Monarch -- **janie**
* Mummy -- **gibdoe**
* Neighbor -- **alazae**
* Ocarina -- **avike**
* Orange -- **mihia**
* Purple -- **simia**
* Red -- **mia**
* Small -- dën- (prefix); **dëna** (adjective)
* Snake -- **rope** (so named for the baddie)
* Trust -- **trèowe**/**trèowag**
* Tunic -- **masoke**
* Undergarment -- **usheoke**
* Yellow -- **hia**

One more thing, and this is for Kasuto:
I was looking through the HLI pages, trying to get a list of ALL the words (including ones I missed. You'll be pleased to know you've got nearly 300 words, not counting what's in the dictionary! :D But I digress), and I ran across a couple that were repeated, but had different meanings in Hylian and I was wondering if you could clear them up for me.

This/That/These/Those: I found a BUNCH of words for those four, like _za, zan, zata, zatan, zu, ziu, zatu_ and _zatiu_. The only conclusion I could draw was that you decided to change the words halfway through and didn't change it on ALL of the pages, so I'm sort of confused as to which means what.

To Write: Two words have come up, _kakirag_ and _katabag_.

Ordinal numbers: Take the stem and add "_-ashe_" for the noun, "_-asha_" for the adjective. I understand that. You have "fourth book" as "_koshasa lërde_" and I'm wondering if that's a mistake and it should be "_koasha lërde_."

Thanks a lot. ^_^;;
