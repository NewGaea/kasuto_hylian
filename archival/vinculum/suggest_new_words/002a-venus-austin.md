> Meanwhile, I was looking at my blog, which happens to have a picture of Link on it. He's shooting an arrow. I wondered to myself, "Well, how would you say tunic? A tunic is like a big shirt...." I don't know how, but I instantly thought that instead of words, there should be a prefix to indicate size (not suffixes, because those indicate parts of speech). I thought of "**ma**" for "big" and "**dën**" for "small." Therefore, a tunic would be "**masoke**," or literally, "big shirt." (A baby-doll tee, on the other hand, would be a **dënsoke**.) 

AS: I think that while these could be valid, the Hylian concept of a shirt and tunic may be similar enough to both be _soke_

> Also, the more you say the prefix, the more you exaggerate the size. Like mamamasoke would be a REALLY big shirt. On top of that, the size is relative. Little Link's tunic would still be called a masoke, because it's a big shirt to him, but if Adult Link were to try and squeeze his way into clothes he wore seven years ago, his head would get stuck inside the dënsoke.

AS: I do like this, especially if the <em>last</em> intensifier in a sequence is forced to carry primary stress for the word?

We have "_kímino•i_" for "little girl" and "_kímilo•i_" for "little boy." Obviously, the N and the L are for girls and boys, respectively. I thought, why not make the N and L prefixes, too? Since undergarments don't have natural gender like goddesses or little boys, the sexual distinction would go at the very beginning (i.e., a sort of exception to the rule). Then we'd have "**nusheoke**" for "girls' underclothes" and "**lusheoke**" for "boys' underclothes." "**Usheoke**" could just stand for general underwear, ne? On top of THAT, "**dënnusheoke**" would be the word for "lingerie" because they're "small-woman-undergarment." Get it?! :::squeals with excitement:::

> Of course, there are two SMALL problems with what I've done.... One: the double n in "_**dënnusheoke**_." Every letter in Hylian is supposed to be pronounced. How do you pronounce two Ns in a row? Two: the N and L prefixes only work for nouns that start with a vowel. What about the ones that start in consonants? I was thinking an apostrophe might work, but then again, it might not. "**N'kamoke**" (girls' boots) doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. It's actually fairly difficult to pronounce.

AS: I think you're misinterpreting Kasuto's rules. _-il-_ makes a word masculine, and _-in-_ makes it feminine, it's not simply the _L_ or the _N._ That leaves the path of _ilusheoke_ and _inusheoke_ if you want them to be prefixes, or you follow the rules Kasuto laid out and use _usheókile_ and _usheókine._

[[011-emekthian|Long consonants are also not that difficult]]: Gemination is one common process when two matching consonants come together. If _dënnusheoke_ is your preference, think of how you might say, "_ten new words_" -- though the problem does disappear with my proposed solution of _dënusheókine_, which uses the process of <em>elision</em> to reduce sequences of the same sound into a single instance of that sound.
