## [[qbri|QBri]] concurs:

That's really weird. The way I see it, Hylian is its own language, alien to our world's languages. So I think that we can count "here" and "there" as adjectives. But if you think it's better to have them as adverbs then we can do that. Either way is fine with me really.

Regarding "this" and "that":

In an earlier post someone wondered what was up with the 4 different words for "_this_" and "_that_", and I thought I'd clear up any confusion:

The only conclusion I could draw was that you decided to change the words halfway through and didn't change it on ALL of the pages, so I'm sort of confused as to which means what.

>> Pronouns ending in _a_ are "adjectival pronouns" or demonstratives, as in "_za lërde_ => that book" while pronouns ending in _u_ are independent pronouns, as in "_zu tairas bagu'sa lërde_ => that is my book"

In english, our words "this" and "that" work both as pronouns (i.e.- this is the best.) and as adjectives (this car is big.), but in Hylian, Kasuto created two separate pairs: "za" and "zata" are adjectives (thus for plurals they must have -n added to the end.) And "zu" and "zatu" are pronouns. For "zu" and "zatu" you must add an -i before the "u" to make them plural (i.e- ziu - these, zatiu - those)

Take a look:

_Za tinske tairas torima._ - _This work is finished._ (note that the adjective form of "this" is used to describe the work. And notice that "finished" is technically an adjective in this context and thust the verb "_torimag_" becomes the adjective "_torima_." In english howered, past tense verbs can act as adjectives so this seems odd to us. But it makes sense if you think about it. *end note)

_Zu tairas vinazwa._ - _This is best/better._ (This uses the pronoun "this" which takes the form of the subject. Remember that the pronoun forms can also be used as objective forms.) *side note - I'm assuming that the suffix **-zwa** is being accepted as the superlative/comparitive suffix. Thus it can be added like so.  :roll:

Guess that that's all for now.

Oh, by the way, I wanted to suggest the word "**upag**" for "_to pray._"

And I guess that that is all....
