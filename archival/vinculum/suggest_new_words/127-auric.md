## [[auric-trinity|Auric Trinity]] bows:

I just don't know how to show accents. accent as you see fit. You're the leader of this movement, mostly. I consider myself a vassal of the Queen

Is there a Hylian word for "face?" Because "mask" could just be face put on the same formula with "-oke."

One more thing:

merkle
SP: mate-ente-rote-lete-kate-ente
monument/gravestone
derived from Merkle (rhymes with Steve Erkul (sp?)) Monuments, a small business near where I live.

Accent as you see fit, my liege.
