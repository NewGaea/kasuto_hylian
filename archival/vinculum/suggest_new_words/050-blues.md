## [[blues-brother|Blues Brother]] ponders:

Hmmm... Since Skeleton is _Stale_... Should we maybe name the different bones? Or maybe just like.... The major limbs... I don't know, I just thought I might drop a suggestion for a new word...

Hey no word for wolf, but who knows, maybe they meant _wolfos_ to be the word for wolf? XD

Do not make me get critcised, I am no good at words. XD Not different languages anyway... Anyway.... What ARE some words you do not have?? Do you have one for Dragon? If you do not.... _Shenro_ or something along those lines might work... (I like dragons. XD Especially serpentine ones. XD The Shenron, or Dragon Gods. XD Like Volvagia. XD)
