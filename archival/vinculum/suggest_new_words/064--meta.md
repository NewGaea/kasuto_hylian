# Words for Wind

In post \#64, **[[pata-hikari|Pata Hikari]]** proposed the word **_silfan_** as the stem for elemental wind: 

![[064-pata]]

This would grammaticalize as **_silfane_** to refer to the element, and **_silfana_** to describe something of the element.

Venus proceeded to propose a new word for wind in post #65:

![[065-venus]]

This leads to a problem however, which is later pointed out in post #87 by **[[qbri|QBri]]**:

![[087-qbri]]

Kasuto had already coined a generic term for "_wind_" in the canonical dictionary! This meant we now had three words for "_wind_" -- the original canonical _fire_ from the dictionary, _silfane_ from Pata's elemental terms, and a now less certain _fethe_ from Venus!

![[088-venus]]

Given that the language had been operating on a general principle of Kasuto's words being absolute and priority given to new words based on when they were submitted, this exposure meant Venus' word was without a gloss! I never quite figured out a solution myself, and just kept all three words in the lexicon, side by side, but maybe you'll be able to, Jerin, or someone else in your HLS?
