> [!NOTE] Multiple Posts
> This actually contains a sequence of back-to-back _selfposts_ from **Auric** who has become determined to submit the 500<sup>th</sup> word to the language. They were archived with minimal distinction, and as the chain taken as a whole is just words from a single person, [[austin_springer|Austin]] chose to combine them all into a single archival post.
