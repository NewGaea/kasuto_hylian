Don't worry about it, because I sort of forgot about it, too. But take your time with it, Magnas. It's not vastly important. ^_^

EDIT: QBri, I've added most of your words to the dictionary. And it took me a while, whew! Most of them went off without a hitch, but I have a couple of questions about some:

1. There are some words whose parts of speech don't match their English counterparts (everyone, sometime, indeed, etc.). In English, they're all either adverbs or pronouns, but you've turned them into regular nouns (with the exception of _jha_ and _vor_, I believe). I'm just wondering if that was on purpose, cuz we discussed that before, or if they should be changed.

2. "_dega_". You mentioned this word once, but never gave it a meaning. Context clues tell me it may mean "illegal", but I'm not sure.

3. "_haiag_", "_aute_", "_koiag_". Not sure if there are supposed to be diphthongs here, so if you'd clarify, I'd appreciate it.

4. I think it was you -- if not, then this goes out to the creator -- who came up with the word "_shgote_" for work. Kasuto's already made up _tïnske_ (and I suppose _tïnskag_ would follow as the verb), so.

5. _via_ vs. _ablat_. You've got them both meaning "by way of." Do you have a preferred one? _Via_ is the only one in the dictionary I've got now.

Thanks a lot.
