## [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] reflects:

We have shadow and darkness already.... unless you mean _lune_ to be used ONLY as the element (and _nasuna_ NEVER to be used for the element), not like "I don't have a shadow cuz the sun went behind a cloud." But then we'd have to get special words for the other five elements, too. That could be interesting, actually.

The other suggestions are great, too, of course. I'll add those to the dictionary post-haste. (Post-haste is a cool word.)
