## Venus, Queen of Faeries responds:

^_^ The Goddesses must have heard my prayers last night when I complained that no one ever posts in this section, so thank you, [[emekthian]]!

As for double letters, I looked over my collection of words Kasuto has made up and found no double letters. Maybe it's just something that doesn't happen in Hylian?

One more thing about making up a language: ease of pronunciation. So, if you don't mind, could you explain exactly HOW one would pronounce the words you've made up because I can't seem to do it.
