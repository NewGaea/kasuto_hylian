Thank you for fixing that for me. I cant find that word in the dictionary so I have no idea what I said. Ok, now I feel silly. I thought for sure that I had not seen "storm" anywhere. oh well. New word.

folbiukoge - earthquake (taken from folkag and biukoge. Literally "rolling earth").

Yes. Its cool. Use it. If something I do helps, then by all means use it.
On the subject of the parts of speech dictionary I do have one started. I have the pronouns and most of the verbs done. I hope this helps. Please send the revised version when you get the chance. Thank you for your time.
