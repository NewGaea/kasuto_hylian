Some of these words may not fit into Hylian -- _aute_ and _kiane_ are useful for those who want to use Hylian in everyday modern life, but this is not the purpose of the language. These words will likely be ignored, or footnoted, in the actual wordlist.

Of particular note, _QBri_ is aware that "where" is _dono_ based on a prior post, so why are _everywhere, somewhere,_ and _nowhere_ derived from a different stem?

EDIT: I eventually realized that QBri wasn't use an "all where" construction, but an "all place" construction. My goodness, that was a bothersome error to make, but I do want it on record that I figured it out! -A
