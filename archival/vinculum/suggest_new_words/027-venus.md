It came to me when I was at work on Friday... someone was wearing a jacket for Montclair Hockey. Montclair is in New Jersey, btw. So then I thought "_Mont clair_" means "clear mountain" in French. And then I thought "_mot_" (pronounced like Moe, the bartender on _The Simpsons_). means "word" in French. And then I thought, there's no word for "word" in Hylian. So, I didn't want it to be too close to the French _mot_, so _mont_ is was. _Monte_ to make it a noun.

Yup, I still think about this stuff. I just want it to continue SO BADLY.... and I wish there were more people interested in this. ;-;
