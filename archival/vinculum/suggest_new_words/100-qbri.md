Okay, sorry, you're right I need to clear up some of these:

1.) A problem in english is that words can often be used as nouns or as adjectives. (i.e. - "all" is a great example. ex. - get all that you can (noun) vs. we all are... (adj. form). Take a quick look:

Toka - all (solely an adjective) Toke - everything/all (noun)
Tokakrone - Forever (noun) vs. Tokakrona - Always (adjective)

The thing is, Hylian words don't quite match up to their english counterparts, so their english translations can be the same for different words. If you tell me the context of the word I used that you think is flawed I'll explain it better. But for now this is all I can tell you.

As for jha and vor, vor can be used as a conjunction. And as for jha, well, sounds (or in this case "interjections") don't always have to follow a strict pattern, since a lot of interjections come from sounds that people cry out under circumstances, so jha could just be irregular.

2.) Give me the context of the word, but I'm pretty sure it's meant to be an adjective form of "dege" which would mean it means "godly" or "divine"

3.) Yes there is supposed to be diphthongs, I just don't know what keys to press to mark it. But they are suppossed to have diphthongs. I don't really think they need to be marked, since "ai" and "au" are already marked in the tutorial as always being one complete sound.

4.) You're right, tinske is the word I should've used. Scrap the "shgote" word.

5.) Keep via. I probably wasn't thinking when I made "ablat" and accidently added it. But you're right keep via.

Okay, if there's nothing else I'll post later.
