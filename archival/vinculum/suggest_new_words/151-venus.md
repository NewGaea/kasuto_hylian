We've actually got ilidane for "storm (noun)," but we could use jhutag for the verb, if that's cool.

The other words seem good, so I'll add those, and yes, I'll send you an updated version of the list. I'm really sorry if the one I sent was inaccurate.

And if you'll e-mail me about it, ANYONE who wants an updated list will receive one when we reach six hundred original words. After that, it's up to you guys to keep track, but I'll do it this one time. ^_^ Incentive to keep up the good work. Really, I'm suprised, impressed, elated and humbled at the amount of suggestions we've received lately. Everyone's doing a lovely job, and I feel bad that I haven't come up with very many myself. XD

Um, once I get bored enough, I'll do the parts-of-speech list. ^_^;; I'm working every day through Sunday at least, so I'm kinda busy now, but maybe I'll get on it on my next day off.

EDIT: Seven new words added, and Dagger341, did you mean "inspiration" to be venage? Only you left off the E and vene is a naughty word. :3 I added it to the dictionary already, but if it wasn't meant to be venage, just let me know. Thanks!
