I think "how many" may be "_tano_" because in the Common Expressions section, there's the question ,"_Edas ta•iu tano_?" which means, "How old are you?" but the question "_Ta•iras ta•iu jano_?" means, "How are you?" Both of them can't mean "how" so I figured the jano to be "how" and tano to be "how many," since the response you would give to "_edas ta•iu tano_" would be a number.

[[065-venus|I made the suggestion, actually.]] I know that "_fire_" is the word for "wind," but, I figured since wind is an element (or at least it is by the time _Wind Waker_ rolls around), it's okay to have an elemental word for wind and a non-elemental word for wind.

I trill mine too. I completely agree with you that they sound better that way.

QBri, would it be so painful to add the dots and accents where you need them? If you need a chart of all the keystrokes, I'd be more than happy to oblige.

One more thing, this goes to everyone. I'm away from home right now and STUPIDLY did not mail myself the Hylian Language .docs and .txts, so if you want them, you're going to have to wait until at least Monday (the 11th). Sorry about that.
