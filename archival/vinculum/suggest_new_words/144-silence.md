## Sage of Silence asks:

I'll admit, I'm lazy and don't want to look in 13 pages of posts, but I was wondering, is there a Hylian word for "until" yet? Right now, I'm using "az", for "to the", but until would suit the phrase much better. It's for a fanfic I'm working on (and is in the post your own fanfic section, if you'd like to get a better idea on how until/to the is being used). I don't know enough about how the language is constructed to suggest a word myself. If there is one, could someone let me know?
