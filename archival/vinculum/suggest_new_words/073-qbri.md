:D Hi there all. I'm a new poster (kind of), but I've followed the Hylian language closely and have decided to start to post here on the board.

Regarding the word "Ab": This basically shows a direct object, if I'm not mistaken. This is great for regular nouns, but to me I've always felt it was kind of awkward for personal pronouns, that's why I'm suggesting the following:

Direct & Indirect Objective Personal Pronouns:

* **mÃ«** (meh) - "me" used as the objective form of "bagu" ðŸ›‘
* **tau** - "you" objective form of "taiu" ðŸ›‘
* **nÃ«** - "us" ðŸ›‘
* **vÃ«** - "you all" ðŸ›‘

Ã«ru, sÃ«ru, and ru don't really need to change in my opinion. But like I said, I've always found it kind of awkward to add "ab" before a personal pronoun when it's in an objective state.

> **AS:** Simply put, this iteration of language doesn't really need these words, and it is explicitly stated in `asonÃ«n` that the pronouns _do not change forms based on role._ To add these to this iteration of Hylian is directly contrary to the intentions of Kasuto.

Examples of how they could be used:

SÃ«ru miaras mÃ«. - "She sees me." or since the objective form can clarify who the "doer" in the sentence is, this allows the sentence structure to be flipped easily:
MÃ« sÃ«ru miaras. - "Me she sees"

Diarans ru ank nÃ« - Give it to us.
Bagu amkanas tau - I love you.
Tau amkanas - "you loves" can be understood as "You I love"

Good idea? Bad idea? Just something I liked and thought I would share.
Thanks for any input.
