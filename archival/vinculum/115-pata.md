Ok, basicly I've worked out a hylian system of measurement, because I doubt they would use ours. =D

First is a matra this is equal to 3 inches. Nine matra make a dënleto. Four dënleto make a chuka. twenty-one chuka make a leto. eleven leto make a teri. And three teri make a maleto

1 maleto = 1.18125 miles (Yes, I did the math.)
