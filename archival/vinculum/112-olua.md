You do realize that this is ALL YOUR FAULT. ::kicks, then finds a comfy chair in the front of the classroom.::

First of all, 451? Holy shit, V. I knew you guys had it fairly developed but GODDESSES not that well! Of course, my first mission is to learn all of OniGanon's Gerudo rules. Then I'll worry about the Hylian rules. But eh.

While I was scrounging through looking up words for Mikari's broken Hylian, I realized there weren't many words for food. Food is important you know. Not so much specific foods like cheese and fish and roasted cucco. But breakfast and lunch and dinner. 'pologies if you have any of these down already, eh? If anything, you can recycle the words. Oh, and do the whole grammar correct bit too, cuz hell if I know what I'm saying.

So at first I was going to base the words off of breakfast lunch dinner themselves, in some other language maybe. But then I realized, what are they? Meals. When? Prospectively, morning, afternoon, evening. So the quickest and easiest thing to do?

malsete = meal. mahl-seh-teh. literally 'group of food'.
minazisete = breakfast.
tiudrisete = lunch.
naâ€¢istrisete = dinner.

Gee, I'm gonna feel real stupid if someone already came up with this.
