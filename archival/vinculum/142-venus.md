Yya, new faces!!! Sorry about the hiatus, you guys. I'm usually quick to respond to new posts, but I was avoiding all game-related forums until my completion of Twilight Princess.

Oh my Goddesses.

Anyway, I thank you for your contributions. I need to get to bed soon, but your words seem good, and I'll look them over more carefully when I get home from work. Thank you so much!

I'm glad the gemstones caught your attention, Stella. Did you know that I derived the word for blue FROM the word for sapphire? XD I'm glad you followed.

And Dagger, I've got your words, too. (The other planets should get words if the dwarf gets one. Tee hee.)
