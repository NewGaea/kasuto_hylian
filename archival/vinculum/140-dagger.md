Yay! my first post! I can now share my creativity with the world! Ok here's my first posted word. How about plute meaning "one who works with metal" or "smith" then plutag could be "to work with metal" or "to smith" both are the same statement, but I want to be as clear as possible. How's that for a first-timer? Let me know what you guys think. Oh yeah, and keep the language alive! :D

So, I also think it's strange that I've had two requests for the dictionary in the past two days. :O!

Oh, and happy Halloween. \^\_\^
