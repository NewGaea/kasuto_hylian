Hey, sorry I haven't responded [[tushen|Tushen]]. I was away since Tuesday of last week and couldn't really access the internet and only got back on Sunday night, then work yesterday and... argh.

I can send you the list of words sometime today (Tuesday April 12) because I've got to modify it and add the new words [[qbri|QBri]] and others have suggested, and will have it to you (.txt, .doc available shortly) by midnight EDT. Is that all right? In the meantime, Kasuto's list of words is available here as a .txt file. If you would like a .doc version, let me know, but that'll take a little more time to get to you.

EDIT: Additionally, because I didn't see what you said before, [[kasuto|Kasuto's]] got a list of *some* swear and vulgar words. You can find those at the bottom of the [[09-arkthën|Common Expressions]] page of the [[00-toc|Hylian Language Institute]].

Also, the word for "if" is "_at_" and the word for forming negatives is "_naz_". The possessive "of" depends on singular or plural possession (and also if what is possessed is explicitly stated), but is similar to the apostrophe-S that we have in English. Here's a quick overview:

**Singular object, adjective:**
This is my book.
*Za ta•iras bagu'sa lërde.*

**Plural objects, adjective:**
These are my books.
*Zan ta•iras bagu'san lërdën.*

**Singular object, pronoun:**
This book is mine.
*Za lërde ta•iras bagu'su.*

**Plurarl objects, pronoun:**
These books are mine.
*Zan lërdën ta•iras bagu'sun.*

Hope that helps!

I'm with you on that! "Batá•í" can mean like, "hi" and "jhënta•i" can mean "later" or something.
