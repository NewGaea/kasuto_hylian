## Auric Trinity catches his breath:

Well sorry about this double post, but no one's been here for a couple of days so I'm making sure that it isn't forgotten.

But do not fear! I come with new words.

Word #501
Mahoe - mage
mate-akte-hÃ«nte-ote-ete
Derived from the Japanese word for magic "Mahou"
Furthermore this can be combined with an element to designate a specific type of mage:
Ex: Galanmahoe=Earth mage
Hevonmahoe=Spirit mage

Word #502
Tsukae - operator/user/wielder
Tote-sate-ute-kate-akte-tote-ete
Derived from Japanese verb "Tsukau," to use
This can also be compounded with a weapon (-its "ete" ending.) to denote a warrior that uses that weapon:
Ex: Katentsukae= Swordsman
Garsitsukae= Axewielder, etc.

And finally...
Word #503
Mevine- master of a skill
Mate-ete-vete-ite-note-ete
Derived from "mevyn" (sp?)
This is also capable of being compounded with either of the two above words to denote mastery of a certain art or stand alone as a generic term for a master in the same sense. (i.e. this does NOT mean master in the sense of a commander.)
Ex: Hevonmahomevine= Master spirit mage
Katentsukamevine= Master swordsman (Swordmaster)

Hope to see lots of new faces (or avatars as the case may be :roll: ) here.
Only 497 until the thousandth word.
