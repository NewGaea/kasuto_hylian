First a new word

Gate=Pite
SP: pate-ite-tote-ete
Derived from St. Peter at the Golden Gates

Just a suggestion but why not take the elements and attatch "-pite" for a compass direction. Also to say "northern" or "southern" etc. attach
"-pita" (making it an adjective)

so all in all we have:
Solanpite East

Perlunpite Southwest

Anpite Northeast

Molornpite Southeast

Hevonpite Northwest

Galenpite South

Silfanpite North

And:
Solanpita Eastern

Perlunpita Southwestern

Anpita Northwestern

Molornpita Southeastern

Hevonpita Northwestern

Galenpita Southern (y'all)

Silfanpita Northern
