Well on with the words.

It have botherd me for some while that there only was on gemstone in the langue; siafire . so it took a look on the word, the first part sia which means blue caugth my attention, what if the other gemstones also started whith their color?
then it would be:

Miafire ruby
Sihiafire emerald
Simiafire amethyst
Hiafire topaz

For diamond there would be used a word which means white or clear. I'll go whith white. For white I have made the word Via drived from the Norewgian word for white hvit.
Then we have:

Viafire diamond
