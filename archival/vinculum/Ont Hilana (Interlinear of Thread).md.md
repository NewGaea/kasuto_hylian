new words added:
rëndamag - to practice (from houd "rendaminike")
voalag - to want, wish (from esperanto "voli")
tokre - place (from japanese "tokoro")
omag - to think (from japanese "omou")

1. The construction of "spoken hylian" should probably refer to "written Hylian" as [hilane kataba].
2. The coined term _lintag_ contradicts the later used, and official, _lërne_.
