Do you like the Hylian alphabet, and would like to see it in a font? Well, this is your lucky day! I've gone through a painstaking process to turn those beautiful letters into a True Type font. Now you can download it and type in Hylian.
If for some reason the link doesn't work right, try right clicking the link and selecting "Save Target As..." (Internet Explorer), or "Save Link As..." (Netscape).

How to install the font: Once you have download the font, you must unzip it first, any Zip utility will do. Then open the Start Menu, go to "Settings", and click "Control Panel." Once you're in the control panel, open the "Fonts" folder. It should look something like this:

Now, click "File" and "Install New Font"

Select the folder you unzipped the font file to. Then it should appear in the "List of fonts" box. Select "Hylian" and click "OK". Congratulations! Now you have the Hylian font installed.

Using the font: If you want to just play around with the letters, then go ahead. But if you want to actually type real words, you have to know which keystrokes give which letters. I recommend using Character Map if you can't find the letter you want. Here is a table of all the Hylian letters, their keystrokes, and which transliterated letter they correspond to. An important note: in the characters where you have to use the "Alt" key, in order to get the letter to come up, you hold down "Alt" and punch in the number with the Numpad (make sure numlock is ON).

> **NOTE:** If you are using our Hylian 3.0 font, you may notice that some of the rows in this table look like duplicates. Jerin and the Hylian Linguistic Society have worked hard to ensure that all documented characters are included, and that we both (a) preserve compatibility with Kasuto's records and (b) update the font encoding as Kasuto never did after initial release.
> 
> This means there are multiple valid ways to enter some of the letters, as Kasuto preferred to map them to more easily accessible symbols, while the HLS has opted to map every character, as near as possible, to its romanization.
> 
> There may be some cases where Kasuto's mapping fails due to these updates, and the table below should at least show you the proper way, or ways, to enter any character in Hylian.
> 
> Our future Hylian 4.0 font will adopt the name "Classical Hylian," and will break compatibility with some letters in prior encodings. Because of this, we will still have the Hylian 3.0 font available, in case you need to encode (or decode) text in Kasuto's manner -- our other fonts already break compatibility.
