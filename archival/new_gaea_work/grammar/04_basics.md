# A Basic Overview of the Hylian Language
---

Before we address the grammar in more technical bits, it's understandable that you readers will want an overview of the language to satisfy the mildly curious and to intrigue the more curious among you.

Classical Hylian is similar to Esperanto in how it marks words though it is simpler than Esperanto. The language contains articles, marks all words in Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun, or Vocative forms.

In addition to this, each word is marked for other aspects: Nouns, Pronouns, and Adjectives are marked for number (singular or plural), while Verbs are marked for Tense and certain other aspects or moods.

The Vocative is a special form used for generating names, often using either simple or compound words, frequently (but not always) adding a gender form, followed by the vocative suffix.

Most words in Hylian are formed by inflecting word _stems_, a fundamental part that can serve as the basis for any other type of word, and which often sits unmodified in compound words.

## Nouns

Nouns in Hylian are denoted by the ending \<_e_\> in the singular and \<_èn_\> in the plural. They represent persons, places, and things both concrete and abstract. Simple nouns always follow the same inflection pattern described above.

### Number

#### Singular Nouns

By default, nouns are treated as singular. All words which end with \<e\> are singular nouns, such as _lèrde_ (book) or _brinste_ (arm).

#### Plural Nouns

Plural nouns are marked by the \<èn\> suffix. All words which end in this suffix are plural nouns, such as _lèrdèn_ (books) or _brinstèn_ (arms).

| Stem | Singular | Plural |
|:-----|:---------|:----------------|
| **lèrd** | _lèrde_ (book) | _lèrdèn_ (books) |
| **brinst** | _brinste_ (arm) | _brinstèn_ (arms) |

### Gender

Unlike many Indo-European languages, Classical Hylian has no concept of grammatical gender, though it does allow for words to be composed with _semantic_ gender, or the expression of sex or gender of a given noun.

Any noun can be given a gender, and gendered terms like _piàntile_ (father) and _piàntine_ (mother) already use this method: They both share the stem _piant_ (parent), followed by a gender suffix -- \<_-il_\> for the masculine and \<_-in_\> for the feminine -- followed by the normal noun suffix \<_e_\>.

This means that any word hat ends in \<_ile_\> is a masculine singular, \<_ilèn_\> is a masculine plural as in _máshtinèn_ (kings), \<_ine_\> is a feminine singular, and \<_inèn_\> is a feminine plural, as in _déginèn_ (goddesses).

The stress on semantically gendered words remains where it would be in the neutral gender, and so must be indicated by an _asènta_ form of the proper vowel.

**NOTE:** Only **nouns** and **vocatives** ever take these suffixes, and do so at the end of their stem, before any other suffixes are added. Adjectives describing such words only need to agree with the number of the word.

| Stem | Neuter | Masculine | Feminine |
|:-----|:-------|:----------|:---------|
| **deg**  | _dege_   | _dégile_    | _dégine_   |
| **god**  | god    | god       | goddess  |

## Verbs

All verbs in Hylian follow a single, regular conjugation paradigm. For simplicity, a verb is **conjugated** when it conveys information about who or what is acting, when the action is performed, or other extra information about the verb. Hylian verbs primarily conjugate **only** for tense (when the verb happens), perfect (whethr the verb is complete), and three other forms: the infinitive (to be, to fly, etc.), the imperative mood (commands, rules, etc.), and the gerund being, flying, etc.) -- and every one of these conjugations is totally regular.

_**NOTE:** It's very important to note that the gerund is not well documented in contemporary sources, but is used regularly._

| Stem | Infinitive | Imperative | Gerund |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|:-------|
| **tair** | _tairag_     | _tairans_    | _tairase_ |
| **koem** | _koemag_     | _koemans_    | _koemase_ |
| **goear** | _goearag_   | _goearans_   | _goearase_ |
| **lint** | _lintag_     | _lintans_    | _lintase_ |
| **zhat** | _zhatag_     | _zhatans_    | _zhatase_ |

This tables offers a few useful verb stems for the lesson ahead.

### Verb Tenses

In English, verbs may change to indicate the subject, the number of subjects, and the tense, but in Classical Hylian, only the tense is important. The simplest tense to understand is the present: Things that are happening _now_ or in close time to now. The present tense is formed by adding \<-as\> to a stem, so _tair_ would become _tairas._

```gloss
\ex Bagu tairas.
\gla bagu tair.as
\glb 1S.PRON be.PRES
\glc I am
```
As noted above, Hylian does not conjugate for person or number, so _tairas_ would be used for all referents.

The next tense, which is used very commonly, is the past tense. This refers to events which have already happened. This tense is formed by adding \<_-es_\> to a stem

```gloss
\ex Soniainai-máshtine koemes.
\gla Sonia-in-ai-máshtine koem.es
\glb Sonia-FEM-VOC-ruler-FEM-N food.PAST
\glc Sonia-queen ate.
\ft Queen Sonia ate.
```
Finally, the last basic tense is the future tense, which is used for actions which have not yet happened, but will or are intended to. The future tense is formed by adding \<_-os_\> to the end of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Bagu zhatos ak sèru.
\gla Bag.u zhat.os ak sèr.u
\glb 1S.PRON speak.FUT towards 3SF.PRON
\glc I speak.will to her
\ft I will speak to her
```
### Perfect Verbs

Classical Hylian also contains a perfect tense for all three of its time tenses. The perfect tense simply refers to an action which is completed, though the nuances of this vary based on what time the verb occurs in.

The past perfect is used to refer to past events sequentially. A word in the past perfet tense happened **entirely before** another event in the past. That is to say, the perfect tense refers to an action or event that happened and was completed before another. This tense is formed by add \<_ènt_\> to the end of of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Bagu yaz koemènt az koeme depoto sèru yovtes.
\gla bag.u yaz koem.ènt az koem.e depot.o sèr.u yovt.es
\glb 1S.PRON already food.PASTPERF DIROBJ.DEF food.NOUN before.PREP 3SF.PRON arrive.PAST
\glc I already eaten-had the food before she arrived
\ft I had already eaten the food before she arrived.
```

Next is the present perfect, which refers to an event completed in the past but usually directly relevant to the present. This form is created by add \<_ant_\> to the end of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Bagu miarant ab ru.
\gla bag.u miar.ant ab ru
\glb 1S.PRON see.PRESPERF DIROB 3SN
\glc I see.have DIROB it
\ft I have seen it.
```

Finally, there is the **future perfect**, which refers to an action which is to be completed before another action happens (or is finished). This form is created by adding \<_ont_\> to the end of a stem.

```gloss
\ex Linkiloi yovtos ènt taz minaze èk bagu torimont ab bagu'sa tìnske.
\gla Link.il.oi yovt.os ènt taz minaz.e èk bag.u torim.ont ab bag.u.sa tìnsk.e
\glb Link.MASC.VOC arrive.FUT in DEF morning.NOUN and 1S.PRON finish.FUTPERF DIROBJ 1S.PRON.GEN work.NOUN
\glc Link arrive.will in the morning and I finish.will-be DIROBJ my work.
\ft Link will arrive in the morning, and I will be finished with my work.
```

## Vocatives

Vocatives are special words used to refer to specific **nouns** as individual people, or personified entities. You've seen some of these above, like *Zeldinai*, _Soninai_, and _Linkiloi_, referring to Zelda, Queen Sonia, and Link (respectively).

Vocatives are the expression of **proper nouns**, and have three forms: The neutral, the masculine, and the feminine. They are formed by adding a gender suffix (as defined in **Nouns** above for masculine and feminine, or \<_-èth\>_ for neutral) to a simple or compound stem, followed by the vocative suffix that matches that gender: \<_-ur_\> for the neutral, \<_-oi_\> for the masculine, or \<_-ai_\> for the feminine.

Because the suffixes only combine with one gender to one vocative, the practical realization of this is that \<-èthur\> represents the neutral or genderless vocative, \<_-iloi_\> represents the masculine vocative, and \<_-inai_\> represents the feminine vocative. With this in mind, here are a few names you might find in this documentation:

| Stem | Neutral | Masculine | Feminine |
|:-----|:--------|:----------|:---------|
| **Kasut** | _Kasutethur_ (Kasuter) | _Kasutinoi_ (Kasuto) | _Kasutilai_ (Kasuta) |
| **Jeri** | _Jeriethur_ (Jerier) | _Jeriinoi_ (Jerino) | _Jerilai_ (Jerina) |
| **Din** | _Dinethur_ (Dinèr) | _Dininoi_ (Dino) | _Dinilai_ (Din) |
| **Nayr** | _Nayrethur_ (Nayrèr) | _Nayrinoi_ (Nayro) | _Nayrilai_ (Nayru) |
| **Faror** | _Farorethur_ (Farothe) | _Farorinoi_ (Faroro) | _Farorilai_ (Farore) |
| **Zeld** | _Zeldethur_ (Zeldan) | _Zeldinoi_ (Zeldik) | _Zeldilai_ (Zelda) |
| **Son** | _Sonethur_ (Sonder) | _Soninoi_ (Sonik) | Sonilai (Sonia) |
| **Ruzol** | _Ruzolethur_ (Ruzolan) | _Ruzolinoi_ (Ruzol) | _Ruzolilai_ (Ruzolia) |
| **Tarl** | _Tarlethur_ (Tarlan) | _Tarlinoi_ (Tarlin, Tarlon) | _Tarlilai_ (Tarla, Tarli) |
| **Marl** | _Marlethur_ (Marlan) | _Marlinoi_ (Marlin, Marlon) | _Marlilai_ (Marla, Marli) |

There may be other names you encounter in this documentation, but hopefully this will help you recognize some of the common names. If a proper name refers to an object, like a Castle, Temple, Tower, River, or Lake, those objects should be in the Neutral gender, so for example _Daonkvethur Hilanilai_ refers to **Lake Hylia.** In addition to this, settlements are usually neutral gender, but can be described as masculine or feminine for artistic purposes.

**NOTE 1:** The actual Translation of Hylian names into English is left entirely up to the discretion of an individual translator. _Marlilai_ could as easily be translated as _Malon_ even as a feminine name.

**NOTE 2:** When translating non-Hylian names, such as Michael or Priscilla, you should phonetically translate the name, optionally remove any final vowel, and use _any one_ of the three Vocative suffixes. When translating the names above, you may use _Maikèlur, Maikèloi,_ or _Maikèlai_ as Michael, and _Prìsìllur, Prìsìlloi,_ or _Prìsìllai_ for Priscilla.

### Object Marking

Hylian uses particles to separate and identify the objects of verbs. While it may seem redundant to use a particle in a simple sentence, Hylian does require the use of particles to separate the parts of a sentence.

#### Direct and Indirect Objects

The direct object in a sentence is the object directly being acted upon. For example, "I gave the book to Impa." In that sentence, the direct object is _the book.

An indirect object is any other object in the sentence, particularly an object which the direct object relates to. In our example above, the indirect object is _Impa._ Using that same sentence, let's explore how Hylian addresses these objects.

```gloss
\ex Bagu diarag az lèrde ank Impailai.
\gla bag.u diar.es az lèrd.e ank Impa.il.ai
\glb 1S-PRON give-PAST DIROBJ.DEF book-NOUN INDOBJ Impa.FEM.FVOC
\glc I gave (DIROBJ).the book (INDOBJ) Impa.
\ft I gave the book to Impa.
```
