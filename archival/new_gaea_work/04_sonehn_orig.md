## Declensions

A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. An important characteristic of Hylian nouns is that the vast majority of them follow a regular pattern. Unlike English, in which nouns can have almost any ending, Hylian nouns all have the same ending. Plurality is also indictated by a regular pattern. Below are the two noun endings.

### Singular Nouns

All regular singular nouns have an -e ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -e can only be a singular noun and nothing else.

### Plural Nouns

All regular plural nouns have an -ën ending. No other part of speech has this ending. So a word that ends in -ën can only be a plural noun and nothing else.

| Stem         | Singular        | Plural            |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| **\*lërd**   | lërde (_book_)  | lërdën (_books_)  |
| **\*brinst** | brinste (_arm_) | brinstën (_arms_) |

## Gender

Many languages, such as Spanish and French, assign nouns a _grammatical_ gender. For example, the Spanish word _lapíz_, which means "pencil," is masculine while the word _fotografía_, which means "photograph," is feminine. If this makes no sense to you, then you're on the right track. (ED: Cut the snark about other languages when you're making a language yourself, Kas) In other languages grammatical gender is assigned to all words, even inanimate objects. However, in English, words have no grammatical gender. They only have a natural (ED: _semantic_) gender, i.e. "woman" is feminine, and "man" is masculine. Hylian also uses natural gender for words. It has an invariable definite article which does not change with gender. There are gender neutral words, as well as gender specific words, as in English. There is a regular way of turning a gender neutral word into a gender specific word. Here are some examples:

* lErde (_lërde_)	Book - Gender neutral
* piante (_piante_)	Parent - Gender neutral
* pi&ntile (_piántile_)	Father - Gender specific, masculine
* pi&ntine (_piántine_)	Mother - Gender specific, feminine

### Forming Gender-Specific Words

Forming a gender-specific noun confroms to a regular pattern. It involves taking the word stem and adding a suffix. When a gender suffix is added to the word, please note that an accent mark is added to preserve the stress of the original word. Here is an example using dege, which means "deity" or "god":

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only nouns can take a gender-specific suffix, adjectives don't. When using an adjective to describe a gender-specific noun, the adjective only has to agree in number.


| Neutral Word | Stem | + | Suffix | + | e | = | New Word | Meaning |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| dege | deg | + | -il | + | e | = | dégile | god (masculine) |
| dege | deg | + | -in | + | e | = | dégine | god (feminine), goddess |
