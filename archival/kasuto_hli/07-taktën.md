Adjectives are words that describe nouns or pronous. They give some kind of information about the modified word. Adjectives also follow a regular pattern. All adjectives have the same ending. However, some words have the same ending as adjectives, but are not adjectives. Some common exceptions will be shown later. Adjectives can come before or after the word they modify, but it is more common to see an adjective come after the noun. Adjectives are the only other part of speech other than nouns that change ending when plural. Adjectives must agree in number with the noun or pronoun they modify; singular words take a singular adjective, and plural words take plural adjectives. The two adjective endings are shown below. 
 
Singular Adjectives
Plural Adjectives
=a
-a
All regular singular adjectives have an -a ending. There are some exceptions, but those will be listed later. A singular adjective is used only with a singular noun or singular pronoun.	
=an
-an
All regular plural adjectives have an -an ending. There are no exceptions for plural adjectives. A plural adjective is used only with a plural noun or plural pronoun

SPECIAL NOTE: The order of nouns and adjectives in Hylian is fairly loose. They can come either before or after the nouns they modify, but afterward is more common.

Demonstrative Adjectives

    A demonstrative adjective is a word that specifies what a noun is. In Enlgish, they are equivalent to "this", "that", etc. These words are always followed by a noun, and always describe a noun, e.g. "this book." Here are the most commonly-used demonstrative adjectives in Hylian:

za	za	this	za itsakupande - this encyclopedia
zan	zan	these	zan itsakupand?n - these encyclopedias
zata	zata	that	zata itsakupande - that encyclopedia
zatan	zatan	those	zatan itsakupand?n - those encyclopedias

Possessive Adjectives

    These adjectives show possession of something. In English, words like "my" and "your" can be pronouns or adjective, depending on context. The same is true in Hylian, this section deals with the adjective form of possessives. Any word can be made into a possessive adjective by adding a simple suffix "-'sa" or "-'san", depending on whether or not the word being modified is plural or singular; these are equivalent to English's use of the apostrophe+s. Please note that when adding this suffix, the stress of the original word is preserved, but there is no written accent mark. Here are some examples:

zu t@ras kasuto'sa lErde. 
Zu ta.iras Kasuto'sa l?rde. 
This is Kasuto's book.	ziu t@ras kasuto'san lerdEn. 
Ziu ta.iras Kasuto'san l?rd?n. 
These are Kasuto's books.
sEru t@ras bagu'sa pi&ntine. 
S?ru ta.iras bagu'sa pi?ntine. 
She is my mother.	iru t@ras bagu'san pi&ntinEn. 
Iru ta.iras bagu'san pi?nt?n. 
They are my parents.
Eru t@ras sEru'sa akime. 
?ru ta.iras s?ru'sa akime. 
He is her friend.	iEru t@ras sEru'san akimEn. 
I?ru ta.iras s?ru'san akim?n. 
They are her friends.
IMPORTANT NOTE:When nouns or pronouns are made into possessives, grammatically they become adjectives and behave like adjectives. Kasuto is a noun, but Kasuto'sa is an adjective.

Using Numbers as Adjectives

    Numbers are frequently used as adjectives. They are used when telling the quantity of something, or telling how many things there are. Using a number strictly as and adjective, i.e. as in There are three people here, is stricly a matter of changing the ending of the number. 
  
  
Cardinal Numbers

    Cardinal numbers are simple counting numbers, as in one, two, three. In Hylian, the nound forms would be hire, dise, troe. To turn a cardinal number into an adjective, simply change the -e ending to an -a or -an ending, depending on whether or not it's plural. Most of the time, only hire(one) will be used in the singular, and the rest are plural. Please note that in large compound numbers, as in sid?me kose (seventy-four), only the last word in the number changes to an adjective ending, e.g. sid?me kose becomes sid?me kosa.

d?me ontan	siEru tEnSas ab dEme ontan r;piEn. 
Si?ru t?nshas ab d?me ontan r?pi?n. 
They have eighteen rupees.
Ordinal Numbers

    An ordinal number is used to tell the rank or position of something in a list or group. It is equivalent to English's use of words like first, second, third, fourth, fifth and so on. In Hylian, ordinal numbers are formed by taking the word base (e.g., the word base of hire is hir) and adding -ashe for the noun form or -asha for the adjective form. Here are some examples:

I?ru ta.iras taz hirashan hit?n kwa vies ak hirule. 
They are the first people that went to Hyrule.

Predicate Adjectives

    A predicate adjective describes the subject of a sentence, linked to the subject with a linking verb (such as "to be" in English). Like simple noun-adjective phrases, the predicate adjective must agree with the subject in number. The subject could be a simple noun, a group of nouns, or a pronoun. Here are examples of simple sentences with predicate adjectives.
