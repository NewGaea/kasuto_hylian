## Forms of Address

In Hylian, there is a myriad of ways to address people. Most of the time, people don't simply use a person's name. Often, they attach some kind of word to the end of the name to indicate respect, frienship, or love. This is similar to the many suffixes that Japanese uses, like "_-san_", "_-sama_", etc.

### Names

<aside>Jerin: The comment about middle names seems to be dated as both the _King of Red Lions_ and _King Rhoam_ both have identifying names. It may be that it is common among nobility or royalty, but not the lower classes?</aside>

Names are the base for most forms of address. In Hylian culture, a person's first name, or "given name" is usually used. Some people have family names, but they are seldom used. Giving people a middle name is very uncommon in Hyrule, and you almost never see it.

When saying a person's full name, the family name (surname) and first name (given name), the family name is always said first. For example: _Ruzantaze Zelda. Ruzantaze_ is the surname of Hyrule's royal family, _Zelda_ is the given name of the princess. Most of the time, a person's family name is only used when introducing someone. More commonly you will see a person's place of origin used instead of a family name. For example: _Kasuto da•ia Katane_. _Kasuto_ is the given name, and _Katane_ is Kasuto's place of origin, _Kataan_. The word _da•ia_ means "of." For instance, Impa is from Kakariko village, so she could be addressed as _Impa da•ia Kakariko._

### Honorific Titles

Most of the time however, people are simply addressed by their given name and a suffix. The different suffixes attached to people's names are listed below. 

| Suffix | Example | Explanation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| <span class="hylian_kas">=kumi</span><br>_-kumi_ | <span class="hylian_kas">kasuto'kumi </span><br>_Kasuto'kumi_ | Used between close friends as a sign of friendship. |

| <span class="hylian_kas">=maSta</span><br>_-mashta_ | <span class="hylian_kas">harikana'maSta </span><br>_Harikana'mashta_ | This is an honorific expression, used when addressing a king or queen. It could be translated as "Your Majesty" or "Sire." |
| <span class="hylian_kas">=maji</span><br>_-maji_ | <span class="hylian_kas">zelda'maji </span><br>_Zelda'maji_ | An honorific used when addressing a prince, princess, or other royalty socially lower than a king or queen. |
| <span class="hylian_kas">=SulO</span><sup>1</sup><br>_-shulo•i_ | <span class="hylian_kas">miyamoto'SulO</span><sup>1</sup><br>_Miyamoto'shulo•i_ | This is used only with a person's family name. It is used for men and is equivalent to "Mister." It is rarely used.
| <span class="hylian_kas">=S;linO</span><br>_-shúlino•i_ | <span class="hylian_kas">ruzantaze'S;linO</span><br>_Ruzantaze'shúlino•i_ | This is used only for a person's family name. It is used for women and is equivalent to "Miss" or "Mrs." It is rarely used.

> [!NOTE] Hylian Typo?
> **Jerin:** While it is my preference to not change Kasuto's Hylian text, I have had to change the _shulo•i_ line to remove an extra character which caused the Hylian text to read _shulo•iá•ú_. I consider this on par with the spellchecking being done in the English text for typos, but want to note this particular correction all the same.

### Casual Terminology

There are also stand-alone forms of address that are words by themselves and are used without names. They are generally used with strangers when you don't know their name.

| Hylian Text | Romanized Text | Explanation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| <span class="hylian_kas">kuzO</span> | _kuzo•i_ | Used when addressing an adult male or a male of the same age. It is equivalent to "sir." |
| <span class="hylian_kas">k;zinO#</span> | _kúzino•i_ | Used when addressing an adult female or a female of the same age. It is equivalent to "ma'am", or "madam." |
| <span class="hylian_kas">k[milO</span> | _kímilo•i_ | Usually used when addressing a male child. It is euivalent to "kid", or "little boy." |
| <span class="hylian_kas">k[minO</span> | _kímino•i_ | Usually used when addressing a female child. It is equivalent to "kid", or "little girl." |
