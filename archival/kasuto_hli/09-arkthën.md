Forms of Address

 In Hylian, there is a myriad of ways to address people. Most of the time, people don't simply use a person's name. Often, they attach some kind of word to the end of the name to indicate respect, frienship, or love. This is similar to the many suffixes that Japanese uses, like "-san", "-sama", etc.

Names

  Names are the base for most forms of address. In Hylian culture, a person's first name, or "given name" is usually used. Some people have family names, but they are seldom used. Giving people a middle name is very uncommon in Hyrule, and you almost never see it. 
    When saying a person's full name, the family name (surname) and first name (given name), the family name is always said first. For example: Ruzantaze Zelda. Ruzantaze is the surname of Hyrule's royal family, Zelda is the given name of the princess. Most of the time, a person's family name is only used when introducing someone. More commonly you will see a person's place of origin used instead of a family name. For example: Kasuto da?ia Katane. Kasuto is the given name, and Katane is Kasuto's place of origin, Kataan. The word da?ia means "of." For instance, Impa is from Kakariko village, so she could be addressed as Impa da?ia Kakariko. Most of the time however, people are simply addressed by their given name and a suffix. The different suffixes attached to people's names are listed below.
