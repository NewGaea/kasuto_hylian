The Hylian number and mathematical system is exactly the same as the Arabic numeral system. It uses base-10 numerals, where each successive numeral increases in value by a power of ten (in other words, they write and use numbers the same way we do).

However, the way numbers are written out in words and how they are pronounced is very different from our system. There are some similarities, and they become easy to understand once you've learned them.

Numbers greater than one thousand are slightly more complicated. For numbers greater than one thousand and less than one million, you must use the special conjunction do before the thousands number (except when it is only one thousand). Here is a formula for saying the number: thousands number (hundreds+tens+ones+do+male) + hundreds + tens + ones.

Note that Hylian places the equivalent of a period between the thousands column and the hundreds column. Essentially, Hylian places a period whenever we would use a comma.
