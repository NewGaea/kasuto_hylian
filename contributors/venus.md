**Venus** was the original poster, and primary word-logger, of the thread _Suggest New Words_ on The Vinculum. She is presumed female and has a friend referred to as **[K-Chan](contributors/k-chan)** (sometimes as **K-Chan'kumi**) who did not post on The Vinculum.

**Venus** started the thread to help keep the language alive and developing, and if she is still interested in the language, the HLS will welcome her with open arms.
