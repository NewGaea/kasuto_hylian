# QBri

QBri was a member of the Vinculum forums. Once they started to get involved, they always had fairly insightful posts about the linguistics, though they did come in with a very _opinionated_ response to the use of _ab_ before pronouns in the object roles of sentences...

QBri gave a proposal for _accusative_ pronouns, and a lot of input on other parts of speech during the Vinculum's heyday.
