# Kasuto of Kataan

The legend who started the language, **Kasuto** had first published the language documentation on his website during or before 2006. As the HLS begins this project, he is the single greatest contributor to the language, having produced all of the documentation and nearly 400 official words. The best place to see Kasuto's contributions is to read through the **[Hylian Language Institute Archive](archival/kasuto_hli/00-contents).**
