# Jerin of Calatia
---
**Jerin of Calatia,** not to be confused with the **Jerin** found in _Breath of the Wild_ and _Tears of the Kingdom,_ is a founding member of the **Hylian Linguistics Society.** Jerin, like **[Kasuto](contributors/kasuto)**, is a figure both within Hyrule and in the real world where we explore Hyrule through the games. **Jerin** also works on other conlang projects, and took over the lead on Hylian from **[Austin Springer](austin-springer.md)**

As of July 2023, **Jerin** is the primary active maintainer and contributor.
