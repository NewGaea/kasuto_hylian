# OniGanon

**OniGanon** was a user on **Kasuto's Vinculum Forums.** Little is known about them as we begin our archival, but they appear to have given good advice to [**Venus**](contributors/venus) early on in the thread, when she was struggling with the concept of gender in Hylian words.

OniGanon also worked on a **Gerudo language** project! We would love to recover that and include it in future updates to the HLS.
