# Oluademi Wolfwood

Oluademi Wolfwood, or Olua for short, was a member of the Vinculum forums who offered input on the language within the _Suggest New Words_ thread. Their gender is unknown, and so they will be referred to using the singular _they_ for now.

Olua suggested the word **_kÃ«wle_** meaning _fish,_ which was apparently the result of a typo ([[venus|Venus]] claims this in the post where she presents the word, crediting it to Olua). This is the first word in the archived dump of the thread which credits anybody other than [[venus|Venus, Queen of Faeries]] or [[k-chan|K-Chan]] as its contributor... but much later on, Olua actually gets logged in [[austin-springer|Austin's]] archival work!
