# Austin Springer
---
**Austin Springer,** also recorded here as **Austin** or **AS,** was the maintainer of the project from February 2016 until June 2023. Austin is **non-binary** and identifies with the pronouns _they_ and _them_. They largely provided analysis and commentary over the Vinculum discussion while dredging the archives for words to include in the official community mirror of the language. While Austin still contributes behind the scenes, they have left the analysis, updates, and other work largely to **[Jerin of Calatia](contributors/jerin-of-calatia)** and the **Hylian Linguistic Society.**
