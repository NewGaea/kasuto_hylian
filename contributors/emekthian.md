# Emekthian

**Emekthian** was a member of the Vinculum Forums, where they were one of the earlier, very enthusiastic, and some might say weirder, contributors to the _Suggest New Words_ thread. Their gender is not known, so they will be referred to by neutral, singular they/them pronouns.

**Emekthian** had a tendency to suggest words that felt further from English, Western European, and Japanese than many other contributors, and expressed some degree of opinionation over what sounds they considered "beautiful" or appropriate for particular languages.

**Emekthian** is recorded as claiming to have a Kokiri (Gágïrhi) language during the thread, which contains uvular sounds, which they "happen to like."
