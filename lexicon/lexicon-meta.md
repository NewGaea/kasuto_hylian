# Neo-Modern Meta Lexicon

This document contains words coined which are strictly out-of-scope for the Hylian Language because they refer to things entirely outside of the world and setting of the Zelda series. This includes a variety of words which are most relevant to real-world references, such as real-world locations or languages which do not have parallels in Hyrule or the rest of the Zelda series. Within this list, they are listed plainly, as every word in this list exceeds the canonical scope of Neo-Modern Hylian.
