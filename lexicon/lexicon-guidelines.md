As changes from the original documentation by Kasuto:

1. The HLS uses a new romanization, and an updated version of Kasuto's original fonts. It is our objective to, as near as possible, allow text to be fully legible in plain Latin script as well as Hylian font faces, though certain digraphs will exist purely for this purpose. In general, we advise using case-sensitive spellings to avoid this.
2. The romanized diphthong marker \<•\> is being removed. Instead of this marker, an apostrophe \<'\> may be inserted after a diphthong if needed for clarity.
3. The diphthong \<oa\> is being phased out in favor of \<ö\>, with the stress-marked version \<óá\> becoming \<ô\> instead.
4. The circumflex \<^\> is relacing the grave \<\`\> as the preferred marker for modified vowels' _asënta_ forms.
5. We are incorporating the following phonemes and letters which were not originally present:
	1. /ts/ as \<c\>
	2. /tS/ as  \<ch\> or \<C\>
	3. /ŋ/ as \<ñ\> or \<ng\>
	4. /D/ as \<dh\> or \<D\>
	5. /x/ as \<x\> or \<kh\>
	6. /oo/ as <ŭ> 
6. Grammatical suffixes are not listed as their own entries. However, to make up for this change, more words are listed in multiple grammatical forms!

In addition to this, the following basic rules are used:

1. This is a lexicon, not a full dictionary. As such, our format is
	+ **word** (pro nun ci a tion) _wordclass._ 1. glosses 2. separate glosses. 1. comments on sense. 2. comments on sense. 1. coinage credit 2. coinage credit
2. We are seeking to only list basic word forms. Many words can be built through compounding or grammatical processes, therefore we primarily focus on:
	+ **Singular** nouns, pronouns, and adjectives
	+ **Infinitive** forms of verbs
	+ Otherwise documented forms such as adverbs, prepositions, etc., in their simplest construction
3. Any word which ends with a star \<\*\> is a word preserved from the original documentation by Kasuto which does not otherwise fit the documentation he provided (for example, many words ending in \<i\> are expressions, but there is no clearly defined rule for grammatical use of this suffix).
4. Any word which begins with a star\<\*\> is a word inferred from the rules of the language but not documented by Kasuto, not documented by it's original submitter(s), or created through analytical processes applied to another word.
