### 2023-Sep-05

### 2023-Sep-06

+ ***ïnigag*** (ɪ.'ni.gag) _verb._ 1. to create or produce (something) 2. to illustrate, paint, or weave 1, 2. see _inige_

This is also the root for the name **_Ïnigaro_** which means something like "Skillful Man," and is the in-world name of ***Ingo*** the stablehand from Lon Lon Ranch.

### 2023-Sep-07

+ **malö'a** 1. compassionate, concerined, caring 2. connecting, holding a group together
+ **malö'ag** 1. to tend to, to care for 2. to bring people together

This is the root for the name of **Malon** in Ocarina of Time, which in native form would be ***Malöune***

### 2023-Sep-08

+ ***tálona*** (tæ.'lo.na) _adjective._ 1. lazy, slow 1. unlike English, this word is not necessarily negative 1. from _Talon_ of Lon Lon Ranch 1. (Jerin)

+ ***tálonag*** (tæ.'lo.nag) _verb._ 1. to laze about 1. unlike English, this word is not necessarily negative 1. see _tálona_ 1. (Jerin)

This word is derived from the personality of Talon as seen in Ocarina of Time, and is also the basis for his name: **Tálonaso** "the lazy (man)"

### 2023-Sep-09

Today we have a pair of compound words from existing coinages:

+ ***akondaja skolire*** (,a.kon.'da.d͜ʒa sko.'li.re) _noun phrase._ 1. cloud barrier, sky barrier 2. a barrier between realms 1. literally composed as "sky-cloud shield" 2. refers to the borders or distinctions between realms like the Sky and Surface, or Hyrule and the Sacred Realm
+ ***akondaja kamicae*** (,a.kon.'da.d͜ʒa ,ka.mi.'t͜sa.e) _noun phrase._ 1. cloud passage, cloud portal 2. a portal between realms 1. literally composed as "sky-cloud door" 2. refers to any way to traverse a barrier between realms like the Sky and Surface, or Hyrule and the Sacred Realm

This pair of words refers primarily to spiritual or magical barriers (and passages through them) between realms, such as the Cloud Barrier which keeps Skyloft and the Surface from seeing each other in Skyward Sword, but can also refer to other ways in which a "realm" is hidden or shielded from interference, and the ways in which such shields can be penetrated. Of note: _akondaja kamicae_ would generally refer to long-term portals, rather than a controllable gate like the Gate of Time or Mirror of Twilight.

### 2023-Sep-10

+ ***vate*** ('va.te) _noun._ 1. bird egg 1. from Latin _ova_ "egg" 1. (Austin)
+ ***grohën*** ('gro.hɛn) _mass noun._ 1. grain, rice, corn 2. **grohe** _singular_ grain, kernel, seed 1. when referring to food or crops, the plural form is typical 2. the singular form is considered unusual, but is preferred in agricultural planting 1, 2. from Latin _granum_ "grain" 1. (Jerin)
+ ***fäwirag*** (fæ.'wi.ɹag) _verb._ 1. to cook, to bake 1. from _faeuire_ "fire" 1. (Jerin)

+ ***fäwivagrohe*** (fæ.,wi.va.'gro.he) _compound noun._ 1. egg-rice, _tamago gohan_, eggy porridge; 1. from Japanese *tamago kake gohan* "egg on rice"; a dish of freshly cooked grains (seasoned or otherwise) served with (often raw) egg on top; a contraction of _fäwira vate ont grohën_ "cooked egg on grains" 1. (Austin)

### 2023-Sep-11

+ ***fethoke*** _noun._ 1. sailcloth, parachute, paraglider 1. from _fethe_ "wind" and _okag_ "clothing"
+ ***fethokag*** _verb._ 1. to glide, to descend through the sky in a controlled manner
+ ***fethoka*** _adjective._ 1. held aloft, suspended in the air

### 2023-Sep-12

+ ***tecaye*** _noun._ 1. cat, feline 2. flexibility, agility
+ ***tecaya*** _adjective._ 1. feline, cat-like 2. flexible, agile, lithe
+ ***tecayag*** _verb._ 1. to pounce 2. to attack from hiding

**NMH Word of the Day for 2023-Sep-13**

+ ***parte*** 1. fortune, chance, luck
+ ***parta*** 1. lucky, fortunate
+ ***partag*** 1. to tempt fate, to gamble

The Hylian concept of luck is largely about coincidences and unpredictable events. Winning a game of chess isn't about *parte* but about skill and experience. Winning a lottery is about *parte.* Of the goddesses, **Farore** is most associated with fortune, good and bad, so she is often thanked for significant events that seem unpredictable.

+ ***dëmetroan partën*** 1. a day of particular fortune or misfortune 1. literally "thirteen lucks"
+ ***parte daia Faroreske*** 1. an incredible or amazing fortune or misfortune 1. especially used when misfortune and fortune seem intertwined to produce extraordinary outcomes.

There is also a saying, "Faroreske partas ab taz linkrën" which translates as "Farore fortunes the courageous." It's very close to the idea of "fortune favors the bold," in English, though it's more active and is sometimes said as a blessing or mild prayer.

### 2023-Sep-14

+ ***reme*** 1. rat 2. \[slang] a glutton, someone who sneaks food from others 3. \[culinary] fat, grease, oil 1, 2, 3. (Jerin)
+ ***rema*** 1. swift, sudden 2. \[slang] gluttonous, greedy 3. \[culinary] fat, greasy, oily 1, 2, 3. (Jerin)
+ ***remag*** 1. to startle, to surprise 2. \[slang] to overeat 3. \[culinary] to make a mess of oneself while eating 1, 2, 3. (Jerin)

The real-world inspiration for today's word is Remy from Pixar's _Ratatouille_, and the idea of a rat in a kitchen inspired some of the reach of this word. Rats aren't seen as inherently bad in my take on Hyrule, and are more favored as small pets than mice due to their sociability. Sense 3 is actually a bit rude when used outside of the culinary context, but even **remag (3)** can be seen as positive within the proper context (it's something like enjoying a meal so much that you lose track of your appearance, which can be complimentary to a cook or chef)

### 2023-Sep-15

+ **alale** (a.'la.le) 1. soundplay, verbal nonsense, baby talk 2. onomotapoeia, idiophone 3. non-lexical words, minor utterances which do not follow grammatical rules
+ **alala** (a.'la.la) 1. singsong, childish (of speech) 2. \[social] engaged, attentive 3. (**alala monte**) a word representing something through a vocalization
+ **alalag** (a.'la.lag) 1. to make nonsensical sounds or words 2. to listen attentively

### 2023-Sep-16

+ ***chújële*** 1. gel, slime (monster) 2. jelly, jam
+ ***chújëla*** 1. wriggly, squirmy
+ ***chújëlag*** 1. to slide, to roll, to skate
+ ***chúzole*** 1. zol, big chuchu 2. blob, mess
+ ***chúzola*** 1. undulating, jiggly
+ ***chúzolag*** 1. to undulate, to tremble, to shake

Derived from the **Gel, Zol** and **Chuchu**, this member of the **chuchu** family is known for its ability to merge into a larger **chúzole** or be split into smaller **chújële.** These slimy monsters are believed to have a shared mind which enables them to merge or split freely.

This all leads into today's....

### 2023-Sep-17

+ ***ushtoere*** _noun._ 1. underworld, depths 2. cave, cavern, hollow 2. a person or creature from the underworld
+ ***ushtoera*** _adjective._ 1. underground 2. monstrous, demonic
+ ***ushtoerag*** _verb._ 1. (intransitive) to be buried, to be covered up 2. (transitive) to invade

From _ushe,_ a euphemism for "crotch, loins" from _usho_ "under, below" combined with _toere_ "world"

#### Sep-17 Bonus

and while it's not the word of the day, I'm going to borrow from French for a construction: **toka toere** is equivalent to _tout le monde_ and can be read literally as "all (the) world" but is also regularly used as both "everywhere," and "everybody"

+ **ushe** _noun._ 1. the lower part of something, the bottom 2. \[euphemism] loins, crotch, genitals
+ **usho** _preposition._ 1. under, below, beneath
+ **usha** _adjective._ 1. covered, concealed

### 2023-Sep-18

+ ***shïmilde*** (ʃɪ.'mil.de) *noun.* 1. slime, living slime 2. stagnant water, especially with mold or algae on top
+ ***shïmilda***  (ʃɪ.'mil.da) *adjective.* 1. slimy, viscuous 2. shiny, reflective
+ ***shïmildag***  (ʃɪ.'mil.dag) *verb.* 1. to cover or coat in a viscous material 2. to varnish, to seal or treat wood against weather 3. to polish, to clean a surface to reflective or shiny quality

### 2023-Sep-19

### 2023-Sep-20

+ **depominaze** (de.,po.mi.'na.ze) 1. yesterday morning
+ **deponaistre** (,de.po.'nais.tre) 1. yesterday evening, last night

Interestingly, the Hylian _week_ doesn't seem to have been defined yet, so I'll think over that today and see what I come up with.

### 2023-Sep-21

+ ***dënaistre*** _noun._ 1. evening, twilight, dusk 1. from _dëna_ "small, little, lesser" and _naistre_ "evening, night"
+ ***dëminaze*** _noun._ 1. dawn, daybreak, sunrise 1. from _dëna_ "small, little, lesser" and _minaze_ "morning"

### 2023-Sep-22

+ ***raputa*** adjective. 1. fated, destined, prophesied 2. predictable, obvious (especially in hindsight)
+ ***raputag*** verb. 1. to prophesy, to read fortunes 2. to predict

Because there's people going around claiming the Rapture is happening this weekend, I wanted a word to build off of it.
#### Sep-22 Bonus

+ **vete** 1. wheat, barley, corn; may be used for most sorts of cereal grain, particularly those grown in dry conditions
+ **garnoe** 1. root (especially root vegetables) 2. carrot
+ **kine** 1. buddleja, safflina; (by extension) herb
+ **rause** 1. rice; may be used for cereal grains which resemble rice, or which are grown in wet environments
+ **woekmote** noun. 1. proverb, advice
+ **woekwite** noun. 1. rule, law

both are compounds derived from _woeke_ "wisdom" or _woeka_ "wise," these words refer to mortal wisdom and laws rather than spiritual, divine, magical, or physical laws:

+ **nairuwite** noun. 1. law, order, structure; refers to the laws of reality and magic which are discovered by studying the world, and which were established by the Goddess Nayru

### 2023-Sep-23

+ **vorue** _noun._ 1. gold 1. back-formation from _votoëre_ "golden land," with some influence from Latin _aurum_ "gold"
+ **harzhe** _noun._ 1. silver 2. polished metal that resembles silver 1. from French _argent_ "silver"
+ **kubre** _noun._ 1. copper 2. copper alloy, bronze, brass 1. from English _copper_
+ **ferte** _noun._ 1. iron 2. iron alloy, steel 1. from Latin _ferrum_ "iron"

### 2023-Sep-24

- **vatike** _noun._ 1. fatigue, exhaustion, weariness 2. boredom, disinterest
- **vatika** _adjective._ 1. tired, weary, exhausted 2. bored, disinterested
- **vatikag** _verb._ 1. to become tired 2. to lose interest 

Despite the similarity to the name of the Legendary Wizard **Vaati** this word does not have a long /a/, and does not indicate frustration, just a normal fatigue. The origin of the word IRL is English _fatigue_ swapping the consonant voicing between the first and last syllables
#### Sep-24 Bonus

- **tornag** _verb._ 1. to run, to flee, to escape

### 2023-Sep-25

+ **pike** 1. pike (fish) 2. large freshwater fish
+ **pika** 1. edible (of seafood)
+ **pikag** 1. to breathe in water, as a fish or Zora

While it looks like I just copied the word, I put a fair bit of thought into this. Having saltwater and freshwater, and especially with Zora, I thought it might be good to distinguish between fish from the two environments. **Pikën** may be able to survive in brackish environments, but not the sea.

### 2023-Sep-26

- **alboeke** _noun._ 1. spiritual power 2. magic
- **alboeka** _adjective._ 1. spiritual, sacred 2. magical, mystical

- **alboekita** _adjective._ 1. possessing inherent spiritual or magical powers
- **alboekitag** _verb._ 1. to develop one's spiritual or magical powers

There will be another set of words for people who gain spiritual or magical powers through training or study, but **alboek\*** seemed like a good lemma to establish. The word comes from previously established _albe_ (holiness) and _woeke_ (wisdom)

### 2023-Sep-27

- **kabote** _noun._ 1. kitchen, larder, scullery 1. any room in a household which is dedicated to the storage, preparation, and cleaning up after of food and meals
- **kabota** _adjective._ 1. dry and cool 2. (of a room) suitable for storage, especially of food

- **bote** _noun._ 1. bottle, jug, bowl, cup

#### Sep-27 Bonus

And **bot'hite** is a person who works with the bottles... so a **bot'hítile** is a butler!

Jerin has suggested that _barzhie_ be "wyrm, serpent, dragon" and _bwalke_ for "volcano" allowing _**bwalbarzhie**_ to be "volcano dragon." It does sound really good.

She notes that the Japanese form is ヴァルバジア (va-ru-ba-ji-a); if it's a proper name, it would be **Bwalbarzhiera**

+ **énasra** _adjective._ 1. of quality contrary to that which is claimed 2. timeless, eternal, immortal
