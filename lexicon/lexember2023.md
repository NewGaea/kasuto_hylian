**Mudoran**

I'm going to start by refining the glosses of the Mogma root, which prior to today means (loosely) "underground, tunnel, dig" -- these are now all condensed into reading 1, allowing the other three readings to be filled in:

The initial \<m> in this root seems to be unstable, but this root seems like it could be related to affectionate words like *akime, amkane, kime, kume,* as well as to words like *biukoge, gome* (the latter being "apology, regret").

## Day 14: Trades & Crafts

It's easy to label many professions or roles by simply nominalizing the present tense, as demonstrated by Kasuto when he referred to the Golden Goddesses as **kriashasën** "creators." By extension, we can also make this a singular, but I like the quirk of referring to a profession, a role, or a notable actor of a given verb being referred to as a plural, so here's a grammar rule:

**Verbal Agent Nominalization**

The person who performs a verb may be referred to by adding \<**-e**> to the end of the simple present or past verb form \<**-as, -es**>. This modifier cannot be applied to *future* tenses or *perfect* forms. However, when referring to a profession -- whether of an individual or in general -- it is always inflected as a generic plural. This creates the agent or profession form meaning "one who does X."

:leaf_korok: **lañvag** _verb._ 1. to know, understand, or speak a language 2. to study language 3. to lick, to taste 4. to express one's preferences
