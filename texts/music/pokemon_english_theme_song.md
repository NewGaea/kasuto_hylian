# English Theme Song to Pokémon (Indigo League) Anime

## English Lyrics

### Verse 1 ###

I want to be the very best,<br/>
Like no-one ever was.<br/>
To catch them is my real test,<br/>
To train them is my cause.

I will journey across the land,<br/>
searching far and wide,<br/>
each Pokémon to understand<br/>
the power that's inside.

### Refrain ###

(Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all!)
It's you and me,
I know it's our destiny!

(Pokémon!) Ah!
You're my best friend,
In a world we must defend.

### Refrain 2 ###

(Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all!)
Our hearts so true,
Our courage will pull us through!
You teach me and I'll teach you,
Pokémon!

### Verse 2 ###

Every challenge along the way,
with courage I will face.
I will battle every day,
To claim my rightful place.

Come with me, the time is right,
there's no better team.
Arm in arm we'll win the fight,
it's always been our dream!
