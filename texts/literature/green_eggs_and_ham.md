## Commentary

This is a cleanly formatted sample book using UTF-8 encoded English. **Take Note** that the inline HTML tag \<br/\> may be used to separate lines within a verse or poetic text, while the blank line paragraph separator is used between verses or segments of a poem or song.

In this case, as a children's book and being written with rhyming meter, each page (or spread) is separated as a verse, while the lines within a page (or spread) are separated with the inlint HTML tag \<br/\>.

Of particular note in translating this book are the meter (you may need to change the meter to fit your language) and the repetitive nature of the lines, with little change in each subsequent verse, even as the passages tend to grow longer.

This is a book for pre-school or early grammar school ages, so the vocabulary should ideally be kept to simple words. How would your language need to change this story to keep the simple word patterns and rhymes intact, if it's even possible?
