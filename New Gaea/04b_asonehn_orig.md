# Asonën Hilanan

A pronoun is a word that takes the place of another noun. These are used in the same way as nouns, and can take adjectives as modifiers. Unlike in English and other languages, Hylian pronouns do not change form when they are used as subjects or objects. For example, in English, the first person singular pronoun is I when used as a subject, as in I went home. I is used as a subject. But when used as an object, as in He saw me, it changes from I to me. Hylian pronouns use the same form for subjects and object. The first person singular pronoun is bagu, when used as a subject it is bagu, but when used as an object it is given one of the object particles as in ab bagu and ank bagu. Note that Hylian pronouns usually end in -u. Below is a list of the most common pronouns used in Hylian.

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are the ones most commonly used. Like all pronouns, they take the place of another noun. Personal pronouns are most often used as subjects in sentences, such as I read the book; or as objects, Bob saw me. Unlike in English, Hylian pronouns do not have different forms depending on their function in a sentence. Particles like ab and ank tell if a pronoun is used as a subject or object.

**Third person plurals:** The third person pronouns retain the (grammatical) gender-specific aspects of the older Hylian languages. Most of the time, the pronoun _iru_ is used when referring to a group of people. It can refer to things, or to a mixed group of males and females. _Siëru_ is used for a group of all females, and _iëru_ is used for a group of all males.

**Impersonal pronoun:** This word is technically in the third person category, but it has special uses. It is roughly equivalent to the English use of _one_ or the more colloquial use of _you_. It is used when making general statements that have no specific person in mind.

For an example in formal English: Before one can buy this, one must have enough money.
For the same example in colloquial English: Before you can buy this, you must have money.

Notice that this sentence refers to no one specific, it is refering only to a person who is not named. In Hylian, this sentence would read: Depoto riu panktas ab kirag ru, (riu) sha tëshas ab danre.

### Possessive Pronouns

(ED: The Genitive Case actually applies to all nouns, not just pronouns.)

Possessive ~adjectives~ **pronouns** are simliar to their adjective counterparts, except that they are not directly modifying anything. They almost always come in the predicate of sentences. This is common in English with words like mine, yours, and theirs. Possessive nouns, like adjectives, have different forms for singular and plural. The possessive pronoun always agrees in number with its antecedent (an antecedent is the word that the pronoun refers to). Note that the plural forms of these pronouns are different than other plural pronous. Most plural pronous have an -i inserted to indicate plurality, possessive adjectives have an -n at the end, much like a noun or adjective.

| _bagu'sun_ (mine) | Zatiu lërdën ta.iras bagu'sun. | Those books are mine. |
| _iëru'su_ (his) | Taz danre ta.iras iëru'su. | The money is his. |
| _iëru'sun_ (his) | Zatan pankstën ta.iras iëru'sun. | Those pastries are his. |

## Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses. A relative clause is a phrase that is set off from the rest of the sentence and it tells more about another word in the sentence (usually a noun or pronoun). Relative clauses are only one of many types of clauses, but they are the most common. Relative clauses can be used as adjectives, nouns, or adverbs. This particular part only deals with the pronouns that introduce relative clauses, the uses of the clauses is discussed in another section.

| Pronoun | Translation | Explanation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| kwa | that, who, whom, which | This one word serves functions that multiple words do in English. If you're familiar with Spanish, it is used like _que_. Many times in English, the pronoun is omitted, as in: _This is the book (that) I wrote._ However, in Hylian the pronoun must be used. |
| ki.u | whose | Unlike most other pronouns, this word ony has one form regardless of whether it is modifying a singular or plural word. |
| këm | what | This word is only used for clauses, do not confuse it with the interrogative pronoun kono, which is used for questions. |
