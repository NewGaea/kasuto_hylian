# Konktrakakire Hilana (Hylian Orthography)

## Taz Aktaie Hilana (_The Hylian Alphabet_)

The Hylian Alphabet, called the _aktaie_, was created by the Warlord-turned-King, Ruzol Antons Hyrule, to enforce literacy on his subjects. To use this orthography, you will need to install one of the Fontën Hilanan, or learn how to write it for yourself.

### Volèn Aséntan

Hyrulean has a regular stress paradigm which is only broken if plicitly marked differently from the rules. While the rules are explained later, every vowel has an _asènta_ form which indicates unusual stress. This only affects syllable stress, not the basic sound of the vowel. _Asènta_ forms are indicated with acute accent \<´\> over the simple vowel forms, or the circumflex \<ˆ\> to replace the grave-mark on alternate vowels.

## Taz Konktrakakire Romana (_The Roman Orthography_)

When writing Hylian in Latin script, and not using the font, some sounds are writtn with digraphs, or combinations of letters that may be pronounced differently from how they are pronounced alone, or how you might otherwise expect thm to be. Most of the digraphs used here are included in the table above, but the table below shows a guide to how to map the Hylian font to actual romanized forms.
