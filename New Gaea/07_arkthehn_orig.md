## Forms of Address

In Hylian, there is a myriad of ways to address people. Most of the time, people don't simply use a person's name. Often, they attach some kind of word to the end of the name to indicate respect, frienship, or love. This is similar to the many suffixes that Japanese uses, like "-san", "-sama", etc.

### Names

Names are the base for most forms of address. In Hylian culture, a person's first name, or "given name" is usually used. Some people have family names, but they are seldom used. (ED: It may be more common to use one's home town, village, city, province, or tribe as a de facto surname.) Giving people a middle name is very uncommon in Hyrule, and you almost never see it.

When saying a person's full name, the family name (surname) and first name (given name), the family name is always said first. For example: _Ruzantaze Zelda_. _Ruzantaze_ is the surname of Hyrule's royal family (ED: artificial, all canonically named rulers are named _Hyrule_ within the games), _Zelda_ is the given name of the princess. Most of the time, a person's family name is only used when introducing someone. More commonly you will see a person's place of origin used instead of a family name. For example: _Kasuto da.ia Katane_. _Kasuto_ is the given name, and _Katane_ is Kasuto's place of origin, Kataan. The word _da.ia_ means "of." (ED: genitive of association, _da.ia_ means "of or from") For instance, Impa is from Kakariko village, so she could be addressed as _Impa da.ia Kakariko_. Most of the time however, people are simply addressed by their given name and a suffix. The different suffixes attached to people's names are listed below.


| Suffix | Example | Explanation |
|:-|:-|:-|
| =kumi<br/>(-kumi) | kasuto'kumi<br/>(Kasuto'kumi) | Used between close friends as a sign of friendship. |
| =kani<br/>(-kani) | darunia'kani<br/>(Darunia'kani) | Used for a person you respect but also consider a friend or acquaintance. |
| =kanO<br/>(-kano.i) | kira'kanO<br/>(Kira'kano.i) | Used when talking to a person you don't know, or someone you highly respect. |
| =aki<br/>(-aki) | zelda'aki<br/>(Zelda'aki) | For people you love, usually used between spouses or boyfriends and girlfriends. |
| =aSi<br/>(-ashi) | saria'aSi<br/>(Saria'ashi) | An expression of parental or brotherly love, used by parents when talking to children, or used between siblings. |
| =aSO<br/>(-asho.i) | impa'aSO<br/>(Impa'asho.i) | An expression of love an respect, similar to ashi but is used with social superiors, as in your parents, grandparents, etc. |
| =sEnSi<br/>(-sënshi) | sailan'sEnSi<br/>(Sailan'sënshi) | A special expression used for teachers, professors, or any type of educator. |
| =maSta<br/>(-mashta) | harikana'maSta<br/>(Harikana'mashta) | This is an honorific expression, used when addressing a king or queen. It could be translated as "Your Majesty" or "Sire." |
| =maji<br/>(-maji) | zelda'maji<br/>(Zelda'maji) | An honorific used when addressing a prince, princess, or other royalty socially lower than a king or queen. |
| =SulO<br/>(-shulo.i) | miyamoto'SulO<br/>(Miyamoto'shulo.i) | This is used only with a person's family name. It is used for men and is equivalent to "Mister." It is rarely used. |
| =S;linO<br/>(-shúlino.i) | ruzantaze'S;linO<br/>(Ruzantaze'shúlino.i) | This is used only for a person's family name. It is used for women and is equivalent to "Miss" or "Mrs." It is rarely used. |

There are also stand-alone forms of address that are words by themselves and are used without names. They are generally used with stangers when you don't know their name.

* kuzO (_kuzo.i_): Used when addressing an adult male or a male of the same age. It is equivalent to "sir."
* k;zinO (_kúzino.i_): Used when addressing an adult female or a female of the same age. It is equivalent to "ma'am", or "madam."
* k[milO (_kímilo.i_): Usually used when addressing a male child. It is euivalent to "kid", or "little boy."
* k[minO (_kímino.i_): Usually used when addressing a female child. It is equivalent to "kid", or "little girl."


## Expletives
