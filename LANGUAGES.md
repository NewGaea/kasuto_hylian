# Languages of the HLS

At present, we are documenting only one language: the version of Hylian developed by [[kasuto|Kasuto of Kataan]], members of the Vinculum forums, [[austin-springer|Austin Springer]], and [[jerin-of-calatia|Jerin of Calatia]], as well as any future members of the Hylian Linguistic Society.

We are open to adding new languages in the future, so long as they fit the theme of being Hylian of otherwise based on the worlds of _The Legend of Zelda_ series. Our requirements for adding a language to this project are as follows:

## Requirements

### Attribution
Attribution to the original author of any HLS languages is absolutely mandatory, even if the author has stopped working on the language and does not require contributions to be credited, the HLS will choose to attribute their portion of the work to them (unless they have explicitly stated a desire to _not_ be credited).

### Consent
Consent of the original author is as important to us as Attribution. We will only accept projects which have Free Culture licenses, ranging from a release to the Public Domain or CC0 to CC-Attribution-ShareAlike (note that consent and attribution are both keys to CC-BY-SA) or compatible licenses.

If you have a _Zelda_-themed language project of your own, and you would like to submit it to the HLS, please feel free to make a branch for your documentation. If you know of a _Zelda_-themed language you would like to see included, please contact the original author of that language and direct them our way.

### Originality
While we absolutely welcome the inclusion of words or themes reflecting _The Legend of Zelda_ games and series, we are looking for members and languages which add something unique to their language over and beyond the elements included within the games. This is, generally, not difficult as the games have sample words or sayings at the best, and ciphers beyond that.

### Community
We are seeking languages which are open to community development and contributions. If you want to view yourself as the sole author and creator of your language, we are sorry but the HLS is not for you.

It is our hope to contribute to the linguists and language enthusiasts of the _Zelda_ community with a space where they can indulge their linguistic hobbies with like-interested individual.
